<p>Anthony Robeson glanced about
him in a satisfied way at the
shaded nook under the low-hanging
boughs into which he had guided the
boat. Then he drew in his oars and let
the little craft drift.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an ideal spot,&#8221; said he, looking
into his friend&#8217;s face, &#8220;in which to
tell you a rather interesting piece of
news.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, fine!&#8221; cried his friend, settling herself
among the cushions in the stern and
tilting back her parasol so that the light
through its white expanse framed her
health-tinted face in a sort of glory. &#8220;Tell
me at once. I suspected you came with
something on your mind. There couldn&#8217;t
be a lovelier place on the river than this for
confidences. But I can guess yours. Tony,
you&#8217;ve found &#8216;her&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll be my friend just the same?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
questioned Anthony anxiously. &#8220;My chum&mdash;my
confidante?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, Tony, that&#8217;s absurd,&#8221; declared
Juliet Marcy severely. &#8220;As if <i>she</i>
would allow it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s three thousand miles away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just in the interval, then,&#8221; pleaded
Anthony. &#8220;I need you now worse than
ever. For I&#8217;ve a tremendous responsibility
on my hands. The&mdash;the&mdash;you know&mdash;is to
come off in September, and this is June&mdash;and
I&#8217;ve a house to furnish. Will you help
me do it, Juliet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Anthony Robeson!</i>&#8221; she said explosively
under her breath, with a laugh. Then she
sat up and leaned forward with a commanding
gesture. &#8220;Tell me all about it. What
is her name and who is she? Where did
you meet her? Are you very much&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I marry a girl if I were not &#8216;very
much&#8217;?&#8221; demanded Anthony. &#8220;Well&mdash;I&#8217;ll
tell you&mdash;since you insist on these non-essentials
before you really come down to
business. Her name is Eleanor Langham,
and she lives in San Francisco. Her family
is old, aristocratic, wealthy&mdash;yet she condescends
to me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>He looked up keenly into her eyes, and
her brown lashes fell for an instant before
something in his glance, but she said
quickly: &#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When the&mdash;affair&mdash;is over I want to
bring my bride straight home,&#8221; Anthony
proceeded, with a tinge of colour in his
smooth, clear cheek. &#8220;I shall have no
vacation to speak of at that time of year,
and no time to spend in furnishing a house.
Yet I want it all ready for her. So you see
I need a friend. I shall have two weeks to
spare in July, and if you would help me&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Tony,&#8221; she interrupted, &#8220;how
could I? If&mdash;if we were seen shopping
together&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we couldn&#8217;t go shopping together
in New York without being liable to run
into a wondering crowd of friends, of course&mdash;not
in the places where you would want
to go. But here you are only a couple of
hours from Boston; you will be here all
summer; you and Mrs. Dingley and I could
run into Boston for a day at a time without
anybody&#8217;s being the wiser. I know&mdash;that
is&mdash;I&#8217;m confident Mrs. Dingley would do it
for me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course. Did Auntie ever deny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
you anything since the days when she used
to give you jam as often as you came across
to play with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you <i>her</i> photograph?&#8221; inquired
Miss Marcy with an emphasis which left no
possible doubt as to whose photograph she
meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expected that,&#8221; said Anthony gravely.
&#8220;I expected it even sooner. But I am prepared.&#8221;</p>
<p>She sat watching him curiously as he
slowly drew from his breast-pocket a tiny
leather case, and gazed at it precisely as a
lover might be expected to gaze at his lady&#8217;s
image before jealously surrendering it into
other hands. She had never seen Anthony
Robeson look at any photograph except her
own with just that expression. She had
often wondered if he ever would. She
had recommended this course of procedure
to him many times, usually after once more
gently refusing to marry him. She had
begun at last to doubt whether it would
ever be possible to divert Tony&#8217;s mind
from its long-sought object. But that trip
to San Francisco, and the months he had
spent there in the interests of the firm he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
served, had evidently brought about the
desired change. She had not seen him
since his return until to-day, when he had
run up into the country where was the
Marcy summer home, to tell her, as she
now understood, his news and to make his
somewhat extraordinary request.</p>
<p>She accepted the photograph with a
smile, and studied it with attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but isn&#8217;t she pretty?&#8221; she cried
warmly&mdash;and generously, for she was thinking
as she looked how much prettier was
Miss Langham than Miss Marcy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she?&#8221; agreed Anthony with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lovely. What eyes! And what a dear
mouth!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She looks clever, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How tall is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About up to my shoulder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s little, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; objected Anthony,
surveying his own stalwart length of limb.
&#8220;A girl doesn&#8217;t have to be a dwarf not to be
on a level with me. I should say she must
be somewhere near your height.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a magnificent dresser!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she? She never irritates one with the
fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but I can see. And she&#8217;s going to
marry you. Tony, what can you give her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little box of a house, one maidservant,
an occasional trip into town, four
new frocks a year&mdash;moderate ones, you
know, in keeping with her circumstances&mdash;and
my name,&#8221; replied Anthony composedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t let her live in town, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her! Good heavens, what sort of a
place could I give her in town on my
salary? Now, in the very rural suburb
I&#8217;ve picked out she can live in the greatest
comfort, and we can have a real home&mdash;something
I haven&#8217;t had since Dad died
and the old home and the money and all
the rest of it went.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face was grave now, and he was
staring down into the water as if he saw
there both what he had lost and what he
hoped to gain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Juliet sympathetically,
though she did not know how to imagine
the girl whose photograph she held in the
surroundings Anthony suggested. Presently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
she went on in her gentlest tone: &#8220;I&#8217;m
not saying that the name isn&#8217;t a proud one
to offer her, Tony&mdash;and if she is willing to
share your altered fortunes I&#8217;ve no doubt
she will be happy. Along with your name
you&#8217;ll give her a heart worth having.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Anthony without
looking up.</p>
<p>Miss Marcy coloured slightly, and hastened
to supplement this speech with
another.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is&mdash;since the home is to
be hers&mdash;why not let her furnish it? Her
tastes and mine might not agree. Besides&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;you know, Tony,&#8221; explained
Juliet in some confusion, &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t know
how to be economical.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m aware that you haven&#8217;t been
brought up on the most economical basis,&#8221;
Anthony acknowledged frankly. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll
take care of my funds, no matter how extravagant
you are inclined to be. If I should
hand you five dollars and say, &#8216;Buy a
dining-table,&#8217; you could do it, couldn&#8217;t you?
You couldn&#8217;t satisfy your ideals, of course,
but you could give me the benefit of your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
discriminating choice within the five-dollar
limit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet laughed, but in her eyes there grew
nevertheless a look of doubt. &#8220;Tony,&#8221; she
demanded, &#8220;how much have you to spend
on the furnishing of that house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just five hundred dollars,&#8221; said Anthony
concisely. &#8220;And that must cover the repairing
and painting of the outside. Really, Juliet,
haven&#8217;t I done fairly well to save up that
and the cost of the house and lot&mdash;for a
fellow who till five years ago never did a
thing for himself and never expected to
need to? Yes, I know&mdash;the piano in your
music-room cost twice that, and so did the
horses you drive, and a very few of your
pretty gowns would swallow another five.
But Mrs. Anthony Robeson will have to
chasten her ideas a trifle. Do you know,
Juliet&mdash;I think she will&mdash;for love of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was smiling at his own audacious
confidence. Juliet attempted no reply
to this very unanswerable statement. She
studied the photograph in silence, and
he lay watching her. In her blue-and-white
boating suit she was a pleasant object to
look at.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you help me?&#8221; he asked again at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
length. &#8220;I&#8217;m more anxious than I can tell
you to have everything ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like to fail you, Tony, since
you really wish it, though I&#8217;m very sure
you&#8217;ll find me a poor adviser. But you
haven&#8217;t been a brother to me since the
mud-pie days for nothing, and if I can help
you with suggestions as to colour and style
I&#8217;ll be glad to. Though I shall all the while
be trying to live up to this photograph, and
that will be a little hard on the five-dollar-dining-table
scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve only to look out that everything
is in good taste,&#8221; said Anthony quietly,
&#8220;and that you can&#8217;t help doing. My wife
will thank you, and the new home will be
sweet to her because of you. It surely will
to me.&#8221;</p>

<h2>II.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Measurements</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was on the first day of Robeson&#8217;s
two-weeks&#8217; July vacation that he came
to take Juliet Marcy and her aunt, Mrs.
Dingley, who had long stood to her in
the place of the mother she had early
lost, to see the home he had bought
in a remote suburb of a great city.
It was a three-hours&#8217; journey from
the Marcy country place, but he had
insisted that Juliet could not furnish the
house intelligently until she had studied
it in detail.</p>
<p>So at eleven o&#8217;clock of a hot July morning
Miss Marcy found herself surveying from
the roadway a small, old-fashioned white
house, with green blinds shading its odd,
small-paned windows; a very &#8220;box of a
house,&#8221; as Anthony had said, set well back
from the quiet street and surrounded by
untrimmed trees and overgrown shrubbery.
The whole place had a neglected appearance.
Even the luxuriant climbing-rose, which
did its best to hide the worn white paint of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
the house-front, served to intensify the look
of decay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charming, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Robeson
with the air of the delighted proprietor.
&#8220;Of course everything looks gone to seed,
but paint and a lawn-mower and a few other
things will make another place of it. It&#8217;s
good old colonial, that&#8217;s sure, and only
needs a bit of fixing up to be quite correct,
architecturally, small as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way up the weedy path, Mrs.
Dingley and Juliet exchanging amused
glances behind his back. He opened the
doors with a flourish and waved the ladies
in. They entered with close-held skirts and
noses involuntarily sniffing at the musty air.
Anthony ran around opening windows and
explaining the &#8220;points&#8221; of the house.
When they had been over it Mrs. Dingley,
warm and weary, subsided upon the door-step,
while Juliet and Anthony fell to discussing
the possibilities of the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Anthony, mopping his
heated brow, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t like having big, high
rooms to decorate. These little rooms,&#8221;&mdash;he
put up his hand and succeeded, from
his fine height, in touching the ceiling of
the lower front room in which they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
stood&mdash;&#8220;won&#8217;t stand anything but the most simple
treatment, and expensive papers and upholsteries
would be out of place. It will
take only very small rugs to suit the floors.
The main thing for you to think of will be
colours and effects. You&#8217;ll find five hundred
dollars will go a long way, even after
the repairs and outside painting are disposed
of.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked so appealing that Juliet could
but answer heartily: &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sure of it.
And now, Tony, don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;d
better draw a plan of the house, putting in
all the measurements, so we shall know just
how to go to work? And I will go around
and dream a while in each room. Give me
the photograph, you devoted lover, so I
can plan things to suit <i>her</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony laughed and put his hand into
his breast-pocket. But he drew it out
empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;I&#8217;ve left it behind,&#8221; he admitted
in some embarrassment. &#8220;I really thought
I had it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tony! And on this very trip when
we needed it most! How could you leave
it behind? Don&#8217;t you always carry it next
your heart?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the prescribed place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. I should doubt a man&#8217;s love
if he did not constantly wear my likeness
right where it could feel his heart beating
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I never supposed,&#8221; remarked Anthony,
considering her attentively, &#8220;that
you had so much romance about you. Do
you realise that for an extremely practical
young person such as you have&mdash;mostly&mdash;appeared
to be, that is a particularly sentimental
suggestion? Er&mdash;should you wear
his in the same way, may I inquire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; returned Juliet with defiance
in her eyes, whose lashes, when they fell
at length before his steadily interested gaze,
swept a daintily colouring cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever worn one?&#8221; inquired
this hardy young man, nothing daunted
by these signs of righteous indignation.
But all he got for answer was a vigorous:</p>
<p>&#8220;You absurd boy! Now go to work at
your measurements. I&#8217;m going upstairs.
There&#8217;s one room up there, the one with the
gable corners and the little bits of windows,
that&#8217;s perfectly fascinating. It must be
done in Delft blue and white. Since I
haven&#8217;t the photograph&#8221;&mdash;she turned on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
threshold to smile roguishly back at him&mdash;&#8220;memory
must serve. Beautiful dark hair;
eyes like a Madonna&#8217;s; a perfect nose; the
dearest mouth in the world&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She vanished around the corner only to
put her head in again with the air of one who
fires a parting shot at a discomfited enemy:
&#8220;But, Tony&mdash;do you honestly think the
house is large enough for such a queen of
a woman? Won&#8217;t her throne take up the
whole of the first floor?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she was gone up the diminutive
staircase, and her light footsteps could be
heard on the bare floors overhead. Left
alone, Anthony Robeson stood still for a
moment looking fixedly at the door by
which she had gone. The smile with
which he had answered her gay fling had
faded; his eyes had grown dark with a
singular fire; his hands were clenched. Suddenly
he strode across the floor and stopped
by the door. He was looking down at the
quaint old latch which served instead of
a knob. Then, with a glance at the unconscious
back of Mrs. Dingley, sitting sleepily
on the little porch outside, he stooped and
pressed his lips upon the iron where Juliet&#8217;s
hand had lain.</p>

<h2>III.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Shopping with a Chaperon</span></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Five hundred dollars,&#8221; mused Miss
Marcy, on the Boston train next morning.
&#8220;Six rooms&mdash;living-room, dining-room,
kitchen, and three bedrooms. That&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget,&#8221; warned Anthony Robeson
from the seat where he faced Juliet and
Mrs. Dingley. &#8220;That must cover the outside
painting and repairs. You can&#8217;t figure
on having more than three hundred dollars
left for the inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dear me, yes,&#8221; frowned Juliet. She
held Anthony&#8217;s plan in her hand, and her
tablets and pencil lay in her lap. &#8220;Well,
I can spend fifty dollars on each room&mdash;only
some will need more than others. The
living-room will take the most&mdash;no, the
dining-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The kitchen will take the most,&#8221; suggested
Mrs. Dingley. &#8220;Your range will use
up the most of your fifty. And kitchen
utensils count up very rapidly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a very small range,&#8221; Anthony
said. &#8220;A little toy stove would be more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
practical for our&mdash;the kitchen. How big is
it, Juliet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ten by fourteen,&#8217;&#8221; read Juliet. &#8220;From
the centre of the room you can hit all the
side walls with the broom. Speaking of
walls, Tony&mdash;those must be our first consideration.
If we get our colour scheme
right everything else will follow. I have
it all in my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it proved. But it also proved, when
they had been hard at work for an hour at
a well-known decorator&#8217;s, that the tints
and designs for which Miss Marcy asked
were not readily to be found in the low-priced
wall-papers to which Anthony
rigidly held her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have the softest, most restful
greens for the living-room,&#8221; she announced.
&#8220;There&mdash;<i>that</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is a dollar a roll,&#8221; whispered
Anthony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;<i>that</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighty-five cents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But for that little room, Tony&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five cents a roll is all we can
allow,&#8221; insisted Anthony firmly. &#8220;And
less than that everywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>The salesman was very obliging, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
showed the best things possible for the
money. It was impossible to resist the
appeal in the eyes of this critical but restricted
young buyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, that will do, I think,&#8221; said Juliet
at length, with a long breath. &#8220;The green
for the living-room and for the bit of a hall&mdash;No,
no, Tony; I&#8217;ve just thought! You
must take away that little partition and let
the stairs go up out of the living-room.
That will improve the apparent size of
things wonderfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Anthony obediently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll put that rich red in the
dining-room. For upstairs there is the
tiny rose pattern, and the Delft blue, and
that little pale yellow and white stripe.
In the kitchen we&#8217;ll have the tile pattern.
We won&#8217;t have a border anywhere&mdash;the
rooms are too low; just those simplest
mouldings, and the ivory white on the ceilings.
The woodwork must all be white.
There now, that&#8217;s settled. Next come the
floors.&#8221;</p>
<p>There could be no doubt that Juliet was
becoming interested in her task. Though
the July heat was intense she led the way
with rapid steps to the place where she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
meant to select her rugs. Here the three
spent a trying two hours. It was hard to
please Miss Marcy with Japanese jute rugs,
satisfactory in colouring though many of
them were, when she longed to buy Persian
pieces of distinction. If Juliet had a
special weakness it was for choice antique
rugs.</p>
<p>She cornered Anthony at last, while Mrs.
Dingley and the salesman were politely but
unequivocally disputing over the quality
of a certain piece of Chinese weaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony,&#8221; she begged, &#8220;please let me get
that one dear Turkish square for the living-room.
It will give character to the whole
room, and the colours are perfectly exquisite.
I simply can&#8217;t get one of those
cheap things to go in front of that beautiful
old fireplace. Imagine the firelight
on that square; it would make you want to
spend your evenings at home. Please!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you imagine that I shall ever want
to spend them anywhere else?&#8221; asked
Tony softly, looking down into her appealing
face. &#8220;Why, chum, I&#8217;d like to get that
Tabriz you admire so much, if it would
please you, in spite of the fact that we
should have to pull the whole house up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
forty notches to match it. But even the
Turkish square is out of the question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Tony&#8221;&mdash;Juliet was whispering now
with her head a little bent and her eyes
on the lapel of his coat&mdash;&#8220;won&#8217;t you let me
do it as my&mdash;my contribution? I&#8217;d like to
put something of my own into your house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear little girl,&#8221; Anthony answered&mdash;and
possibly for her own peace of mind
it was fortunate that Miss Langham, of
California, could not see the look with
which he regarded Miss Marcy, of Massachusetts&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m
sure you would. And you
are putting into it just what is priceless to
me&mdash;your individuality and your perfect
taste. But I can&#8217;t let even you help furnish
that house. She&mdash;must take what I&mdash;and
only I&mdash;can give her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re perfectly ridiculous,&#8221; murmured
Juliet, turning away with an expression of
deep displeasure. &#8220;As if she wouldn&#8217;t bring
all sorts of elegant stuff with her, and make
your cheap things look insignificant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she will,&#8221; returned Anthony
with conviction. &#8220;She&#8217;ll bring nothing
out of keeping with the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you told me she was of a
wealthy family.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She is. But if she marries me she leaves
all that behind. I&#8217;ll have no wife on any
other basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;for a son of the Robesons of
Kentucky you are absolutely the most
absurd boy anybody ever heard of,&#8221; declared
the girl hotly under her breath. Then
she walked over and ordered a certain inexpensive
rug for the living-room with the
air of a princess and the cheeks of a poppy.</p>

<h2>IV.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>The Cost of Frocks</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It may have been that Miss Marcy was
piqued into trying to see how little she
could spend, but certain it was that from
the time she left the carpet shop she begged
for no exceptions to Mr. Robeson&#8217;s rule of
strict economy. She selected simple, delicate
muslins for the windows, one and all,
without a glance at finer draperies; bought
denims and printed stuffs as if she had never
heard of costlier upholsteries; and turned
away from seductive pieces of Turkish and
Indian embroideries offered for her inspection
with a demure, &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t care to
look at those now,&#8221; which more than once
brought a covert smile to Anthony&#8217;s lips
and a twinkle to the eyes of the salesman.
It was so very evident that the fair buyer
did not pass them by for lack of interest.</p>
<p>Altogether, it was an interesting week
these three people spent&mdash;for a week it
took. Anthony began to protest after the
first two days, and said he could not ask so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
much of his friends. But Juliet would not
be hindered from taking infinite pains, and
Mrs. Dingley good humouredly lent the two
her chaperonage and her occasional counsel,
such as only the gray-haired matron of long
housewifely experience can furnish.</p>
<p>The selection of the furniture took perhaps
the most time, and was the hardest,
because of the difficulty of finding good
styles in keeping with the limited purse.
Anthony possessed a number of good pieces
of antique character, but beyond these
everything was to be purchased. Juliet
turned in despair from one shop after
another, and when it came to the fitting
of the dining-room she grew distinctly
indignant.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a perfect shame,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that
they can&#8217;t offer really good designs in the
cheap things. Did you ever see anything
so hideous? Tony, if I were you I&#8217;d rather
eat my breakfast off one of those white
kitchen tables&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke off suddenly, rushed away
down the long room to a group of chastely
elegant dining-room furniture and came
back after a little with a face of great eagerness
to drag her companions away with her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
She took them to survey a set of the costliest
of all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you gone crazy?&#8221; Anthony inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. Tony, just study that table.
It&#8217;s massive, but it&#8217;s simple&mdash;simple as
beauty always is. Look at those perfectly
straight legs&mdash;what clever cabinet maker
couldn&#8217;t copy that in&mdash;in ash, Tony? Then
there are stains&mdash;I&#8217;ve heard of them&mdash;that
rub into wood and then finish in some way
so it&#8217;s smooth and satiny. You could do
that&mdash;I&#8217;m sure you could. Then you&#8217;d get
the lovely big top you want. And the
chairs&mdash;do you see the plain, solid-looking
things? I know they could be made this
way. Then the dining-room would be
simply dear!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Juliet, you&#8217;re coming on,&#8221; declared
Anthony with satisfaction that evening as
the two, back at the Marcy country place,
strolled slowly over the lawn toward the
river edge. &#8220;At this rate you&#8217;ll do for a
poor man&#8217;s wife yourself some day. That
frock you have on now&mdash;isn&#8217;t that a sort of
concession to the humble company you&#8217;re
in?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; Juliet glanced down at
the pale-green gown whose delicate skirts
she was daintily lifting, and in which she
looked like a flower in its calyx. She had
rejoiced to exchange the dusty dress in
which she had come home from town for
this, which suggested coolness in each fresh
fold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it strikes me as about the simplest
dress I ever saw you wear. Isn&#8217;t it really&mdash;well&mdash;the
least expensive thing you have
had in that line in some time?&#8221;</p>
<p>The amused laugh with which this observation
was greeted might have been disconcerting
to anybody but Anthony Robeson,
but he maintained his ground with
calmness.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many of these do you think you
can furnish Mrs. Anthony with in a year?&#8221;
Juliet inquired, her lips forcing themselves
to soberness, but the laughter lingering in
her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several, as girlishly demure as that, I
fancy,&#8221; asserted the young man with confidence.</p>
<p>But Juliet&#8217;s momentary gravity broke
down. &#8220;Oh, you clever boy!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I shall advise Mrs. Anthony to send you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
shopping for her when she needs a new
frock. You will order home just what she
wants without stopping to ask the price,
you will be so confident that you know a
cheap thing when you see it. Afterward
you will pay the bill&mdash;and then the awful
frown on your brow! You will have to
live on bread and milk for a month to get
your accounts straightened out. Oh, Tony!&mdash;No,
I shouldn&#8217;t do for a poor man&#8217;s
wife&mdash;not judging by this &#8216;girlishly demure&#8217;
gown, you poor lamb.&mdash;But, Tony,&#8221; with
a swift change of manner, &#8220;I do think the
little house will be very charming indeed.
I can hardly wait to know that the painting
and papering are done, so that we can go
down and get things in order. I long to
arrange those fascinating new tin things
in that bit of a cupboard. Tony&#8221;&mdash;turning
to him solemnly&mdash;&#8220;does <i>she</i> know how
to cook?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she is learning now,&#8221; he assured
her. &#8220;Seems to me she mentioned it in
to-day&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He fumbled in his breast-pocket
and brought out a letter.</p>
<p>Juliet stole an interested glance at it.
She observed that there were three closely
written sheets of the heavy linen paper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
and that the handwriting was one suggestive
of a pleasing individuality. Anthony, in
the dim twilight, was scanning page after
page in a lover&#8217;s absorbed way. Juliet
walked along by his side in silence. She
was thinking of the face in the photograph,
and wondering if Miss Eleanor Langham
really loved Anthony Robeson as he deserved
to be loved.</p>
<p>&#8220;For he is a dear, dear fellow,&#8221; she said
to herself, &#8220;and if she could just see him
planning so enthusiastically for her comfort,
even if he does have to economise,
she&#8217;d&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not in this letter,&#8221; observed
Anthony, putting the sheets together with
a lingering touch which did not escape
his companion&#8217;s quick eyes. &#8220;It must
have been in yesterday&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she write every day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear of an engaged pair
who didn&#8217;t write every day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must take a good deal of your time,&#8221;
she remarked. &#8220;But, of course, she can
cook. Every sane girl takes a cooking-school
course nowadays. It&#8217;s as essential
as French.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did, then?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Don&#8217;t you remember when
I used to edify you with new and wonderful
dishes every time you dropped in to
luncheon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But did you learn the more important
things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I paid especial attention to soups, sir,&#8221;
laughed Juliet. &#8220;Now, if Mrs. Anthony
has done that you can live very economically.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll suggest it to her,&#8221; said Anthony
gravely.</p>

<p>It took several trips to the small house,
and a great deal of hemming and ruffling of
muslin on the part of Juliet and the Marcy
sewing-woman, to say nothing of many
days of Anthony&#8217;s hard labour, to get
everything in place. But it was all done
at length, and the hour arrived to close the
new home and leave it to wait the oncoming
day in September when it should be permanently
opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just go over it once more,&#8221; said
Juliet to Mrs. Dingley. The latter lady
was lying in a hammock out under the
apple trees, waiting for train time and her
final release from duties which were becoming
decidedly wearisome. It was the first
day of August, and the evening was a
warm one. Anthony had gone off upon
a last errand of some sort. Mrs. Dingley
was too exhausted to offer to accompany
her niece, and Juliet ran back into the
house alone. She wandered slowly through
the rooms, looking about to see if there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
might be any perfecting touch which she
could add.</p>
<p>It was a charming place; even a daughter
of the house of Marcy could but own to
that. Under her skilful management the
little rooms had blossomed into a fresh,
satisfying beauty that needed only the
addition of the personal adornment which
Anthony&#8217;s bride would be sure to bring, to
become a home&mdash;the home not only of a
poor man but of a refined and cultured one
as well. Restricted though she had been
to the most inexpensive means of bringing
about this happy result, Juliet had made
them all tell toward an effect of great
harmony and beauty. Perhaps to nobody
was this more of a revelation than to the
girl herself.</p>
<p>She was very proud of the living-room, as
she looked about it. The partition between
it and the tiny hall had been removed, according
to her suggestion, and the straight
staircase altered by means of a landing and
an abrupt turn which transformed it into
picturesqueness. With its low, broad steps,
its slender spindles and odd posts, it added
much to the character of the room.</p>
<p>Like most old New England houses, this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
one&#8217;s chief glory was its great central
chimney, with big fireplaces opening both
into the living-room and the dining-room.
In the former, between the fireplace and the
staircase, and forming a suggestion of an
inglenook, Juliet had contrived a high, wide
seat, cushioned in dull green, and boasting
a number of pretty pillows. It must be
confessed that she had surreptitiously added
a little to these in the matter of certain
modestly rich bits of material, and she
contemplated the result with great satisfaction.
It may be remarked, with no
comment whatever, that in spite of their
beauty there was not a pillow of all those
scattered about the house which a weary
man might not tuck under his head without
fear of ruining a creation too delicate for
any use but to be admired.</p>
<p>Having seized upon the idea of staining
cheap material, she had carried it out in a
set of low bookcases across the end and
one side of the room. These awaited the
coming of the several hundreds of choice
books which Anthony had saved from his
father&#8217;s library. Two fine old portraits,
dear to the hearts of many generations of
the &#8220;Robesons of Kentucky,&#8221; lent distinction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
to the home of their young descendant.
Altogether the room was both
quaint and artistic, and with its few plain
chairs and tables, mostly heirlooms, and all
of good old colonial design, was a room in
which one could readily imagine one&#8217;s self
sitting down to a winter evening of cosy
comfort, such as is not always to be had
in far finer abiding-places.</p>
<p>The dining-room was a study in its reds
and browns, and its home-made furniture
was an astonishing success&mdash;if one were
not too severely critical. As she surveyed
it Juliet seemed to see the future master
and mistress of this little home sitting down
opposite each other in the fireglow, and
smiling across.</p>
<p>The coming Mrs. Robeson, if one might
judge by her photograph, was a woman
to lend grace and dignity to her surroundings,
whatever they might be. Juliet could
imagine her pretty, stately way of presiding
at such small feasts as the room was destined
to see, making her guests quite forget
that she was not mistress of a mansion
equal to any in the land. Would she be
happy? Could she be happy here, after
all that she had had of another and very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
different sort of life? For some reason, as
Juliet stood and looked and thought, her
face grew very sober, and a long-drawn
breath escaped her lips.</p>
<p>The little kitchen was an exceedingly
alluring place, gay in the bravery of fresh
paint and spotless, shining utensils. There
were even crisp curtains&mdash;at eight cents a
yard&mdash;tied back at the high, wide-silled,
triple window with its diminutive panes.
It needed only a pot or two of growing
plants in the window, and a neat-handed
Phyllis in a figured gown, to be the old-time
kitchen of one&#8217;s dreams.</p>
<p>But it was upon the rooms on the upper
floor that Juliet had exhausted her imagination
and effort. Nothing could have been
conceived of more dainty than they. Here
her denims and muslins had run riot. Low
dressing-tables clad in ruffled hangings,
their padded tops delicate with the breath
of orris; beds valanced with similar stuffs;
high-backed chairs, their seats cushioned
into comfort&mdash;everything was done in the
cleverest imitation of the ancient styles in
keeping with the old-fashioned house. It
all made one think of the patter of high-heeled,
buckled slippers, and stiff, rustling,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
brocaded gowns, and powdered hair, and
the odours of long ago. Anthony would
never know what his friendly home-maker
had put into these rooms of sentiment and
charm.</p>

</div>

<p>At the door of the blue-and-white room,
the one upon which the girl had lavished her
most tender fancies, she stood at length,
looking in. And as she looked something
swam before her eyes. A sob rose in her
throat. She choked it back; she brushed
her hand across her face. Then she tried
to laugh. &#8220;Oh, what a goose I am!&#8221; she
said sternly to herself. And then she ran
across the room, sank upon her knees before
the window-seat with its blue and white
cushions, and burying her face in one of
them cried her wretched, jealous, longing
heart out.</p>
<p>Anthony, coming in hastily but softly
through the small kitchen, heard the rush
of footsteps overhead, and stopped. He
waited a moment, listening eagerly; then
he came noiselessly into the living-room and
stood still. His face, always strong and
somewhat stern in its repose, had in it to-night
a certain unusual intensity. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
looked at his watch and saw that there was
an hour before train time. Then he sat
down where he could see the top of the
staircase and waited.</p>
<p>By and by light footsteps crossed the
floor above and came through the little
hall. From where he sat Anthony caught
the gleam of Juliet&#8217;s crisp linen skirt.
Presently she came slowly down. As she
turned upon the landing she met Anthony&#8217;s
eyes looking up. In a fashion quite unusual
to the straightforward gaze of his
friend her eyes fell. He saw that her
cheeks were pale. He rose to meet her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and rest,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You are
tired. You have worked too hard. Such
a helper a man never had before. And
you have made a wonderful success. Juliet,
I can&#8217;t thank you. It&#8217;s beyond that.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she would not be led to the cosy
corner by the window. She found something
needing her attention in the curtain
of the bookcase in the dimmest corner of
the room, and began solicitously to pull it in
various ways, as if there were something
wrong with it. He watched her, standing
with his arm on the high chimney-piece.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you enjoyed it just a little bit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
yourself, though,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
you, chum?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; said Juliet.</p>
<p>Her back was toward him, her head bent
down, but his quick ear detected a peculiar
quality in her voice. He questioned her
again hurriedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not sorry you did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said Juliet.</p>
<p>Now there is not much in two such
simple replies as these to indicate the state
of one&#8217;s mind and heart; but when a girl
has been crying stormily and uninterruptedly
for a half-hour, and is only not
crying still because she is holding back the
torrent of her unhappiness by sheer force of
will, it is radically impossible to say so
much as four words in a perfectly natural
way. Anthony understood in a breath
that the unfamiliar note in his friend&#8217;s
voice was that of tears. And, strange to
say, into his face there flashed a look of
triumph. But he only said very gently:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here a minute&mdash;will you, Juliet?&#8221;</p>
<p>She bent lower over the curtain. Then
she stood up, without looking at him, and
moved toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I&#8217;m rather tired,&#8221; she said in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
a low tone. &#8220;It has been so warm all day,
and I&mdash;I have a headache.&#8221;</p>
<p>In three steps he came after her, stopping
her with his hand grasping hers as she would
have left the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back&mdash;please,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;Your
aunt is asleep out there, I think. I wanted
to go over the house once more with you, if
you would. But you&#8217;re too tired for that.
Just come back and sit down in this nook
of yours, and let&#8217;s talk a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>She could not well refuse, and he put her
into a nest of cushions, arranging them
carefully behind her back and head, and
sat down facing her. He had placed her
just where the waning light from the
western sky fell full on her face; his own
was in the shadow. He was watching her
unmercifully&mdash;she felt that, and desperately
turned her face aside, burying in a friendly
pillow the cheek which was colouring under
his gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the headache so bad?&#8221; he asked
softly. &#8220;I never knew Juliet Marcy to
have a headache before. Poor little girl&mdash;dear
little girl&mdash;who has worked so hard
to please her old friend.&#8221; He leaned forward
and she felt his hand upon her hair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
The tenderness in his voice and touch were
carrying away all her defences. But he
went on without giving her respite.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think <i>she</i> will be happy here,
chum? Will it take the place of the old
life for a few years, till I can give her more?
She&#8217;ll have nothing here, you know, outside
of this little home, but my love. That
wouldn&#8217;t be enough for any ordinary
woman, would it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was not looking at him, but she could
see him as plainly as if she were. Always
she had thought him the strongest, best
fellow she knew. He had been her devoted
friend so long; she had not realised in the
least until lately how it was going to seem
to get on without him. But she knew now.</p>
<p>She felt a dreadful choking in her throat
again. It seemed to be closely connected
with another peculiar sensation, as if her
heart had turned into a lump of lead. In
another minute she knew that she should
break down, which would be humiliating
beyond words. She started up from her
cushions with a fierce attempt to keep a
grip upon herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re very happy,&#8221; she
breathed, &#8220;and I&#8217;m very glad. But really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
I&mdash;I&#8217;m not at all sentimental to-night.
I&#8217;m afraid a headache does not make
one sympathetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she could not get past him; Anthony&#8217;s
stalwart figure barred the way. His strong
hands put her gently back among the
cushions. She turned her head away, fighting
hard for that thing she could not keep&mdash;her
self-control.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it really a headache?&#8221; asked the low
voice in her ear. &#8220;Just a headache? Not
by any chance&mdash;a heartache, Juliet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthony Robeson!&#8221; she cried, but
guardedly, lest the open window betray
her. &#8220;What do you mean? You say very
strange things. Why should I have a
heartache? Because you are marrying the
girl you love? How often have I begged
you to go and find her? Do you think I
would have done all this for her&mdash;and you&mdash;if
I had cared?&#8221;</p>
<p>She tried to look defiantly into his eyes&mdash;those
fine eyes of his which were watching
her so intently&mdash;tried to meet them steadily
with her own lovely, tear-stained ones&mdash;and
failed. Swiftly an intense colour dyed her
cheeks, and she dropped her head like a
guilty child.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I care&mdash;that is, in a way,&#8221;
she was somehow forced to admit before
the bar of his silence. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I
hate to lose the friend who used to carry my
books to school, and fought the other boys
for my sake, and has been a brother to me
all these years? Of course I do. And
when I am tired I cry for nothing&mdash;just
nothing. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was certainly a brave attempt at
eloquence, but perhaps it was not wonderfully
convincing. At all events it did not
keep Anthony from taking possession of
one of her hands and interrupting her with
a most irrelevant speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet, do you remember telling me
that you should expect a man who loved
you to carry your likeness always with
him? And you asked me for <i>hers</i>&mdash;and
I had to own I had left it behind. Yet I
had one with me then&mdash;it is always with
me&mdash;and that was why I forgot the other.
Look.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew out a little silver case, and
Juliet, reluctantly releasing one eye from
the shelter of the friendly sofa pillow, saw
with a start her own face look smiling back
at her. It was a little picture of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
girlish self which she had given him long
ago when he went away to college.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said quickly, as he recognised
the indignant question which instantly
showed in her eyes, &#8220;I&#8217;m not disloyal to
Eleanor Langham. Because&mdash;dear&mdash;there
is no such person.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a little cry she flung herself away
from him among the pillows, hiding her
face from sight. There was a moment&#8217;s
silence while Anthony Robeson, his own
face growing pale with the immensity of the
stakes for which he played, made his last
venture.</p>
<p>&#8220;The little home is only for you, Juliet.
If you won&#8217;t share it with me it shall be
closed and sold. Perhaps it was an audacious
thing to do&mdash;it has come over me a
great many times that it was too audacious
ever to be forgiven. But I couldn&#8217;t help
the hope that if you should make the home
yourself you might come to feel that life
with a man who had his way to make
could be borne after all&mdash;if you loved him
enough. It all depended on that. As I
said, I didn&#8217;t mean to be presumptuous,
but it was a desperate chance with me,
dear. I couldn&#8217;t give you up, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
thought perhaps&mdash;just <i>perhaps</i>&mdash;you cared&mdash;more
than you knew. Anyhow&mdash;I loved
you so&mdash;I had to risk it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet&#8217;s charming brown head was buried
so deep in the pillows that only its back
with the masses of waving, half-rumpled
hair was visible. But up from the depths
came a smothered question:</p>
<p>&#8220;The photograph?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony&#8217;s face lightened as if the sun
had struck it, but he kept his voice quiet.
&#8220;Borrowed&mdash;it&#8217;s my old friend Dennison&#8217;s.
I never even saw the girl&mdash;though I ought
to beg her pardon for the use I have made
of her face. She&#8217;s married now, and lives
abroad somewhere. Will you forgive me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was standing over her, leaning down
so that his cheek touched the rumpled hair.
&#8220;How is it, Juliet? Could you live in the
little home&mdash;with love&mdash;and me?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a long time before he got any
answer. But at last a flushed, wet, radiant
face came into view, an arm was reached
out, and as with an inarticulate, deep note
of joy he drew her up into his embrace, a
voice, half tears, half laughter, cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tony&mdash;you dear, bad, darling, insolent
boy! I did think I could do without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
you&mdash;but I can&#8217;t. And&mdash;oh, Tony&#8221;&mdash;she
was sobbing in his arms now, while he
regarded the top of her head with laughing,
exultant eyes&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad&mdash;so glad&mdash;<i>so
glad</i>&mdash;there isn&#8217;t any Eleanor Langham!
Oh, <i>how</i> I hated her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you, sweetheart?&#8221; he answered,
laughing aloud now. Then bending, with
his lips close to hers&mdash;&#8220;well, to tell the truth&mdash;to
tell the honest truth, little girl&mdash;<i>so
did I</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it,&#8221; repeated Mr. Horatio
Marcy, obstinately, and shook his head for
the fifth time. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not a word to say
against Anthony, my dear&mdash;not a word.
He&#8217;s a fine fellow and comes of a good
family, and I respect him and the start he
has made since things went to pieces,
but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet waited, her eyes downcast, her
cheeks very much flushed, her mouth in
lines of mutiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221; her father continued, settling
back in his chair with an air of decision,
&#8220;you will certainly make the mistake of
your life if you think you can be happy in
the sort of existence he offers you. You&#8217;re
not used to it. You&#8217;ve not been brought
up to it. You can spend more money in a
forenoon than he can earn in a twelve-month.
You don&#8217;t know how to adapt
yourself to life on a basis of rigid economy.
I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t forbid it, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forbid it?&mdash;no. A man can&#8217;t forbid a
twenty-four year old woman to do as she
pleases. But I advise you&mdash;I warn you&mdash;I
ask you seriously to consider what it all
means. You are used to very many habits
of living which will be entirely beyond
Anthony&#8217;s means for many years to come.
You are fond of travel&mdash;of dress&mdash;of social&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father dear,&#8221; said his daughter, interrupting
him gently by a change of tactics.
She came to him and sat upon the arm of
his chair, and rested her cheek lightly upon
the top of his thick, iron-gray locks.&mdash;&#8220;Let&#8217;s
drop all this for the present. Let&#8217;s not
discuss it. I want you to do me a particular
favour before we say another word
about it. Come with me down to see the
house. It&#8217;s only three hours away. We
can go after breakfast to-morrow and be
back for dinner at seven. It&#8217;s all I ask.
My arguments are all there. Please!&mdash;<i>Please!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>So it came about that at eleven o&#8217;clock
on a certain morning in August, Mr.
Horatio Marcy discovered himself to be
eyeing with critical, reluctant gaze a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
quaintly attractive, low-spreading white
house among trees and vines. He became
aware at the same time of a sudden close
clasp on his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; said a low voice in his ear.
&#8220;Does it look habitable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very pretty, very pretty, my dear,&#8221;
Mr. Marcy admitted. No sane man could
do otherwise. The little house might have
been placed very comfortably between the
walls of the dining-room at the Marcy
country house, but there was an indefinable,
undeniable air of gracious hospitality and
homelikeness about its aspect, and its surroundings
gave it an appearance of being
ample for the accommodation of any two
people not anxious to get away from each
other.</p>
<p>Juliet produced an antique door-key of
a clumsy pattern, and opened the door into
the living-room. She ran across to the
windows and threw them open, then turned
to see what expression might be at the
moment illumining Mr. Marcy&#8217;s face. He
was glancing about him with curious eyes,
which rested finally upon the portrait of a
courtly gentleman in ruffles and flowing
hair, hanging above the fireplace. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
adjusted a pair of eyeglasses and gave the
portrait the honour of his serious attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is an ancestor,&#8221; Juliet explained.
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t he give distinction to the room?
And isn&#8217;t the room&mdash;well&mdash;just a little bit
distinguished-looking itself, in spite of its
simplicity?&mdash;because of it, perhaps. The
tables and most of the chairs are what
Anthony found left in the old Kentucky
homestead after the sale last year, and
bought in with&mdash;the last of his money.&#8221;
Her eyes were very bright, but her voice
was quiet.</p>
<p>Mr. Marcy looked at the furniture in
question, stared at the walls, then at the
rug on the polished floor. The rug held his
attention for two long minutes, then he
glanced sharply at his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The colourings of that rug are very
good, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221; she asked with
composure. &#8220;It will last until Anthony
can afford a better one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Marcy turned significantly toward
the door of the dining-room, and Juliet led
him through. He surveyed the room in
silence, laying a hand upon a chair back;
then looked suddenly down at the chair
and brought his eyeglasses to bear upon it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The furniture was made by a country
cabinet-maker who charged country prices
for doing it. Tony rubbed in a very thin
stain and rubbed the wood in oil afterward
till it got this soft polish.&#8221;</p>
<p>The visitor looked incredulous, but he
accepted the explanation with a polite
though exceedingly slight smile. Then he
was taken to inspect the kitchen. From
here he was led through the pantry back
to the living-room, and so upstairs. He
looked, still silently, in at the door of each
room, exquisite in its dainty readiness for
occupancy. As he studied the blue-and-white
room his daughter observed that he
retained less of the air of the connoisseur
than he had elsewhere exhibited. She had
shown him this place last with artful intent.
No room in his own homes of luxury could
appeal to him with more of beauty than
was visible here.</p>
<p>When Mr. Marcy reached the living-room
again he found himself placed gently but
insistently in the easiest chair the room
afforded, close by an open window through
which floated all the soft odours of country
air blowing lightly across apple orchards
and gardens of old-fashioned flowers. His
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
daughter, bringing from the ingle seat a
plump cushion, dropped upon it at his feet.
But instead of beginning any sort of argument
she laid her arm upon his knee, and
her head down upon her arm, and became
as still as a kitten who has composed itself
for sleep. Only through the contact of
the warm young arm, her father could feel
that she was alive and waiting for his
speech.</p>
<p>When he spoke at last it was with grave
quiet, in a gentler tone than that which he
had used the day before in his own library.</p>
<p>&#8220;You helped Anthony furnish this
house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mind telling me how much you
had at your disposal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Five hundred dollars.&#8221; Juliet maintained
her position without moving, and
her face was out of sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did this include the repairs upon the
place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but you know wages are low just
now and lumber is cheap. Having no roof
to the porch made it inexpensive. The
painting Anthony helped at himself. He
worked every minute of his two weeks&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
vacation on whatever would cost most to
hire done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthony worked at painting the house?&#8221;
There was astonishment in Mr. Marcy&#8217;s
voice. He had known the Robesons of
Kentucky all his life. He had never seen
one of them lift his hand to do manual
labour. There had been no need.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Juliet, and the cheek which
rested against her father&#8217;s knee began to
grow warm.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have obtained a somewhat extraordinary
effect of harmony and comfort
inside the house,&#8221; Mr. Marcy pursued. &#8220;It
is difficult to understand just how you
brought it about with so small an expenditure
of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was quite impossible now for Juliet
to keep her head down. She looked up
eagerly, but she still managed to speak
quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> effect, father, and it is art&mdash;not
money. The paper on the wall cost twenty-five
cents a roll, but it is the right paper for
the place, and the wrong paper at ten
times that sum wouldn&#8217;t give the room such
a background of soft restfulness. Then,
you see, the old white woodwork is in very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
good style, and the green walls bring it out.
The old floor was easily dressed to give that
beautiful waxed finish. They told me
how to do that at the best decorator&#8217;s in
Boston. The rug fits the colourings very
well. Anthony&#8217;s old furniture would give
any such room dignity. The portrait lends
the finishing touch, I think. You see, when
you analyse it all there&#8217;s nothing in the least
wonderful. But it looks like a home&mdash;doesn&#8217;t
it? And when the little things are
in which grow in a home&mdash;the photographs,
a bowl of sweet-williams from the garden,
the lovely old copper lamp you gave me on
my birthday&mdash;can&#8217;t you think how dear it
will all be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Marcy glanced down keenly into his
daughter&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a great many things of your
own at home which would naturally come
into your married home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Juliet coloured richly. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered
with steady eyes, &#8220;but except for
the lamp, and the photographs, and a few
such very little things, I should not bring
them. Anthony is poor, but he is very
proud. I couldn&#8217;t hurt him by furnishing
his home with the overflow of mine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Besides&mdash;I don&#8217;t need those things. I
don&#8217;t want them. All I want out of the
old home is&mdash;your love&mdash;your blessing,
dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sharp eyes meeting hers softened
suddenly. Juliet drew herself to her knees,
and leaning forward across her father&#8217;s lap,
reached both arms up and flung them about
his neck. He held her close, her head upon
his shoulder, and all at once he found the
slender figure in his arms shaken with
feeling. Juliet was not crying, but she was
drawing long, deep breaths like a child who
tries to control itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need have no doubt of either of
those things, my little girl,&#8221; said her father
in her ear. &#8220;Both are ready. It is only
your happiness I want. I distrust the
power of any poor man to give it to you.
That is all. Since I have seen this house
the question looks less doubtful to me&mdash;I
admit that gladly. But I still am anxious
for the future. Even in this attractive
place there must be monotony, drudgery,
lack of many things you have always had
and felt you must have. You have never
learned to do without them. I understand
that Robeson will not accept them at my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
hand, nor at yours. I don&#8217;t know that I
think the less of him for that&mdash;but&mdash;you
will have to learn self-denial. I want you
to be very sure that you can do it, and that
it will be worth while.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a little silence, then Juliet
gently drew herself away and rose to her
feet. She stood looking down at the imposing
figure of the elderly man in the chair,
and there was something in her face he had
never seen there before.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just one thing about it, sir,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t possibly spare Anthony
Robeson out of my life. I tried to do it,
and I know. I would rather live it out in
this little home&mdash;with him&mdash;than share the
most promising future with any other man.
But there&#8217;s this you must remember: A
man who was brought up to do nothing but
ride fine horses, and shoot, and dance, must
have something in him to go to work and
advance, and earn enough to buy even such
a home as this, in five years. He has a
future of his own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Marcy looked thoughtful. &#8220;Yes,
that may be true,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I rather
think it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, father&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she bent to lay a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
roseleaf cheek against his own&mdash;&#8220;you began
with mother in a poorer home than this,
and were so happy! Don&#8217;t I know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, dear,&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;That&#8217;s
true, too. But we were both poor&mdash;had
always been so. It was an advance for us&mdash;not
a coming down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no coming down for me.&#8221; There
was spirit and fire in the girl&#8217;s eyes now.
&#8220;Just to wear less costly clothes&mdash;to walk
instead of drive&mdash;to live on simpler food&mdash;what
are those things? Look at these,&#8221;
she pointed to the rows of books in the
bookcases which lined two walls of the
room. &#8220;I&#8217;m marrying a man of refinement,
of family, of the sort of blood that
tells. He&#8217;s an educated man&mdash;he loves the
things those books stand for. He&#8217;s good
and strong and fine&mdash;and if I&#8217;m not safe
with him I&#8217;ll never be safe with anybody.
But besides all that&mdash;I&mdash;I love him with
all there is of me. Oh&mdash;<i>are</i> you satisfied
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Blushing furiously she turned away. Her
father got to his feet, stood looking after
her a moment with something very tender
coming into his eyes, then took a step
toward her and gathered her into his arms.</p>

<h2>VIII.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>On Account of the Tea-Kettle</span></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;This is the nineteenth day of August,&#8221;
observed Anthony Robeson. &#8220;We finished
furnishing the house for my future bride
on the third day of the month. Over two
weeks have gone by since then. The place
must need dusting.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced casually at the figure in white
which sat just above him upon the step of
the great porch at the back of the Marcy
country house. It was past twilight, the
moon was not yet up, and only the glow
from a distant shaded lamp at the other end
of the porch served to give him a hint as to
the expression upon his companion&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to lie awake nights,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;trying to remember just how
my little home looks. I can&#8217;t recall whether
we set the tea-kettle on the stove or left it
in the tin-closet. Can you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You put it on the stove yourself,&#8221; said
Juliet. &#8220;You would have filled it if Auntie
Dingley hadn&#8217;t told you it would rust.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Anthony swerved about upon the heavy
oriental rug, which covered the steps, until
his back rested against the column; he
clasped his arms about one knee, and inclined
his head at the precise angle which
would enable him to study continuously
the shadowy outlines of the face above him,
shot across with a ruby ray from the lamp.
&#8220;I wish I could recollect,&#8221; he pursued,
&#8220;whether I left the porch awning up or
down. It has rained three times in the
two weeks. It ought not to be down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it isn&#8217;t,&#8221; Juliet assured him.
There was a hint of laughter in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was rather absurd to put up that
awning at all, I suppose. But when you
can&#8217;t afford a roof to your piazza, and
compromise on an awning instead, you
naturally want to see how it is going to
look, and you rush it up. Besides, I think
there was a strong impression on my mind
that only a few days intervened before our
occupancy of the place. It shows how
misled one can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no reply to this observation,
made in a depressed tone. After a minute
Anthony went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;These cares of the householder&mdash;they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
absorb me. I&#8217;m always wondering if the
lawn needs mowing, and if the new roof
leaks. I get anxious about the blinds&mdash;do
any of them work loose and swing around
and bang their lives out in the night? Have
the neighbours&#8217; chickens rooted up that row
of hollyhock seeds? Then those books I
placed on the shelves so hurriedly. Are
any of them by chance upside down? Is
Volume I. elbowed by Volume II. or by
Volume VIII.? And I can&#8217;t get away to
see. Coming up here every Saturday night
and tearing back every Sunday midnight
takes all my time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might spend next Sunday in the
new house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. You have so many cares
they would keep you from getting lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony made no immediate answer to
this suggestion, beyond laughing up at his
companion in the dim light for an instant,
then growing immediately sober again.
But presently he began upon a new aspect
of the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet, are we to be married in church?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony!&mdash;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what do you think?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Do you mean that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t. Well&mdash;what
about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we to have a big wedding?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;but that&#8217;s not the question. Do
you want a big wedding?&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated an instant. Then she
answered softly, but with decision: &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony drew a long breath. &#8220;Thank
the Lord!&#8221; he said devoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she asked in some surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never exactly understood why the
boys I&#8217;ve been best man for were so miserable
over the prospect of a show wedding&mdash;but
I know now. A runaway marriage
appeals to me now as it never did before.
I want to be married&mdash;tremendously&mdash;but
I want to get it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>A soft laugh answered him. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
get it over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony sat up suddenly. &#8220;Will we?&#8221;
he asked with eagerness. &#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say &#8216;when&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet&mdash;when are you going to say it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Tony&mdash;dear&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&mdash;put in the &#8216;dear,&#8217;&#8221; he
murmured. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard mighty few of
&#8217;em yet, and they sound great to me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been engaged only two weeks&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And two days&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the little house isn&#8217;t spoiling, even
though you&#8217;re not sure about the tea-kettle
and the awning. I&mdash;you don&#8217;t want
to hurry things&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I!&#8221;&mdash;rebelliously.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m very good and say &#8216;Christmas&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Christmas!&#8217;&mdash;Great Cæsar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Tony&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now see here&mdash;&#8221; he leaned forward and
stared up at her, without touching her&mdash;he
was as yet allowed few of the lover&#8217;s favours
and prized them the more for that&mdash;&#8220;do
you think our case is just like other people&#8217;s?
Here I&#8217;ve been waiting for you all my days&mdash;waiting
and waiting, and tortured all the
time by suspense. Then I lived that month
of July with my heart in my mouth&mdash;you&#8217;ll
never know what you put me through
those days, talking and jollying about
&#8216;Eleanor Langham,&#8217; and never for one instant,
until just that last day, giving me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
the smallest pinch of hope that it was anything
to you except just what it pretended
to be. Then&mdash;I&#8217;ve been a long time without
a home&mdash;and the little house&mdash;sweetheart&mdash;it
looks like Heaven to me. Must I
stay outside till Christmas&mdash;when everything&#8217;s
all ready? Confound it&mdash;I don&#8217;t
want to play the pathetic string, and the
Lord knows I&#8217;m happy as a fellow can be
who&#8217;s got the desire of his life. But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A warm hand came gently upon his hair,
and for joy at the touch he fell silent. Once
he turned his head and put his lips against
the white sleeve as it fell near, and looked
up an instant with eyes whose expression
the person above him felt rather than saw
through the subdued light. By and by she
took up the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are rejoiced that I don&#8217;t want a
great wedding?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Immensely relieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you like best?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t dare tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me what you would like, Julie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course father would say the town
house, even if it were a small affair. Auntie
Dingley would probably agree to having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
it here&mdash;if that were what you&mdash;we&mdash;wanted&mdash;that
is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony looked up quickly. &#8220;Even at
Christmas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;yes. We could come back.
People do that sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Must we do what other people
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you rather not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten thousand times. It seems to me
that the biggest mistake people make is
the way they do this thing. Juliet&mdash;think
of the little house. We made it&mdash;you made
it. For years, without doubt, it&#8217;s to hold
us and our experiences. Do you know I&#8217;d
like to give it this one to begin with?&mdash;I&#8217;m
holding my breath!&#8221;</p>
<p>Plainly she was holding hers. Her head
was turned away&mdash;he could just see her
profile outlined against the ruby light.
And at the moment there were footsteps
inside a long French window near at hand
which lay open into the library. Mr.
Horatio Marcy came out and stood still
just behind them.</p>
<p>Anthony sprang to his feet, and came
forward up the steps. The older man
greeted him cordially. Anthony pulled a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
big chair into position, and Mr. Marcy sat
down. He was smoking and wore an air
of relaxation. He and his guest fell to
talking, the younger man entering into the
conversation with as much ease and spirit
as if he were not fresh from what was to
him at this hour a much more interesting
discussion. Juliet sat quietly and listened.</p>
<p>It grew into an absorbing argument after
a little, the two men taking opposite sides
of a great governmental question just then
claiming public interest. Mrs. Dingley
came out and joined the group, and she and
Juliet listened with increasing delight in
a contest of brains such as was now offered
them. Mr. Marcy himself, while he put
forth his arguments with conviction and
with skill, was evidently enjoying the keen
wit and wisdom of his young opponent. The
elder man met objection with objection, set
up men of straw to be knocked down, and
ended at last with a hearty laugh and a
frankly appreciative:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Anthony&mdash;you have convinced
me of one thing, certainly. There are more
sides to the question than I had understood.
I will admit that you&#8217;ve made a strong
argument. But when I come back I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
down you with fresh material. I shall have
plenty of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going away soon, sir?&#8221; Anthony
asked with some surprise. Mr.
Marcy was a frequent traveller, preferring to
look after various business interests in faraway
ports himself rather than entrust
them to others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I shall be off in a few weeks&mdash;and
for a longer time than usual. I haven&#8217;t
told these ladies of my household yet&mdash;but
this is as good a time as any. Juliet, little
girl&mdash;I may be gone all winter this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She came quickly to him without speaking,
and gave him her regretful answer
silently.</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you go, Horatio?&#8221; Mrs. Dingley
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;About the first of October. I hadn&#8217;t
fully decided till to-day. I had thought of
inviting you two to go with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked with a smile at his sister and
his daughter, then somewhat quizzically
at Anthony. The latter was regarding him
with an alert face in which, as nearly as
could be made out in the dim light, were no
signs of discomfiture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Horatio,&#8221; said Mrs. Dingley, &#8220;I wish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
you would come into the library for a few
minutes. This reminds me of a letter I had
to-day from one of your old friends, asking
when you were to be at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The French window closed on the two
older people. Juliet, left sitting on the
arm of her father&#8217;s chair, found Anthony
behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to go on a voyage to the
Philippines?&#8221; he was asking over her
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure just what I do want,&#8221; she
answered rather breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tea-kettle would rust while you
were gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>He got no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dust would grow inches deep on the
dining-table we polished so carefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet rose and walked slowly to the edge
of the steps. Anthony followed. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
go and walk on the terrace,&#8221; he proposed,
and they ran down to the smooth sward
below. It was a warm night, with no dew,
and the short-shaven grass was dry. All
the stars were out. Anthony walked beside
the figure in white, his hands clasped behind
his back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do white ruffled curtains like those at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
our windows ever grow musty from being
shut up?&#8221; he insinuated gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you write from every port you
touch at? It will take a good many letters
to satisfy me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose what? That you will write?&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet stood still. &#8220;You&#8217;re the greatest
wheedler I ever saw,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a compliment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not meant for one. What am I
to do when I&#8217;m&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Married to me?&mdash;I don&#8217;t know, poor
child. I can only pity you. What do you
think the prospect is for me, never to be
able to get the smallest concession from
you except by every art of coaxing? Yet&mdash;if
I can get this thing I want, by any means&mdash;I
warn you I shall not give up until I&#8217;ve
seen you sail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not see me sail.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wheeled upon her. He had her hand
in his grasp. &#8220;And if you don&#8217;t go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed irresistibly. &#8220;How could I
stay without you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will you marry me before your father
goes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tony, Tony&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t be married without his blessing,
can we?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;dear father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you to-morrow,&#8221; said she.</p>

</div>

<p>Juliet Marcy&#8217;s prospective maid-of-honour
found Anthony Robeson&#8217;s best man
at her elbow the moment she entered the
waiting-room of the big railway station.
Now, although she greeted him with a
charming little conscious look, there was
nothing either new or singular about the
quiet rush he had made across the waiting-room
the instant he saw her. The rest of
the party of twenty people who were going
down into the country to the Marcy-Robeson
wedding understood it perfectly, although
the engagement had not been
announced and probably would not be until
Wayne Carey should have an income
decidedly larger than he had at present.</p>
<p>Judith Dearborn joined the group at once,
and Carey reluctantly followed her. Judith
had a way of joining groups and of giving
her betrothed many impatient half-hours
thereby.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think of this,&#8221; she said to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
others. &#8220;When I knew Juliet had really
given in to Anthony Robeson at last I
thought I should be asked to assist at an
impressive church wedding. But here we
are going down to what Tony describes as
&#8216;a box of a house&#8217; in the most rural of
suburbs. If it&#8217;s really as small as he says
even twenty people will be a tight fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How in the world did they come to be
married there?&#8221; asked the sister of the
best man. Everybody had been summoned
to this wedding so hurriedly and so
informally that nobody knew much about it.</p>
<p>The son of the Bishop&mdash;whose father
was going down to perform the ceremony&mdash;answered
promptly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony tells me its Juliet&#8217;s own choice.
You see they furnished the house together,
with her aunt, Mrs. Dingley; and Juliet fell
so in love with it that she must needs be
married in it. What&#8217;s occurred to that
girl I don&#8217;t know. After the Robesons
of Kentucky lost their money and everything
else but their social standing I
thought it was all up with Anthony. But
he&#8217;s plucky. He&#8217;s made a way for himself,
and he&#8217;s won Juliet somehow. He seems to
be a late edition of that obstinate chap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
who remarked &#8216;I will find a way or make
one.&#8217; By Jove&mdash;he must have made one
when he convinced Juliet Marcy that she
could be happy in a house where twenty
people are a tight fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the train stopped at the small station
Judith Dearborn said in Wayne Carey&#8217;s
ear, as he glanced wonderingly from the
train: &#8220;Is this it? Juliet Marcy must be
perfectly crazy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She certainly must,&#8221; admitted Robeson&#8217;s
best man. But he stifled a sigh. If
Juliet Marcy could do so crazy a thing as
to marry Anthony Robeson on the comparatively
small salary that young man&mdash;brought
up to do nothing at all&mdash;was now
earning, why must Wayne Carey wait for
several times that income before he could
have Juliet&#8217;s closest friend? Was there
really such a difference in girls?</p>
<p>But at the next instant he was shouting
hilariously, and so was everybody else except
the Bishop and the Bishop&#8217;s wife, who only
smiled indulgently. The rest of the party
were young people, and their glee brooked
no repression. The moment they reached
the little platform they comprehended not
only that they were coming to a most informal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
wedding&mdash;they were also in for a
decidedly novel lark.</p>
<p>Close to the edge of the platform stood a
great hay-wagon, cushioned with fragrant
hay and garlanded with goldenrod and
purple asters. Standing erect on the front,
one hand grasping the reins which reached
out over a four-in-hand of big, well-groomed,
flower-bedecked farm horses, the other waving
a triumphant greeting to his friends, was
Anthony Robeson, in white from head to
foot, his face alight with happiness and
fun. He looked like a young king; there
could be no other comparison for his
splendid outlines as he towered there. And
better yet, he looked as he had ever looked,
through prosperity and through poverty,
like a &#8220;Robeson of Kentucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Below him, prettier than she had ever
been&mdash;and that was saying much&mdash;her eyes
brilliant with the spirit of the day, laughing,
dressed also in white, a big white hat
drooping over her brown curls, stood Juliet
Marcy.</p>
<p>In a storm of salutations and congratulations
the guests rushed toward this extraordinary
equipage and the radiant pair who
were its charioteers. All regrets over the
probable commonplaceness of a small country
wedding had vanished.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 306px;'>
&#8220;Standing erect ... one hand grasping the reins ... was Anthony Robeson.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Might have known they would do things
up in shape somehow,&#8221; grunted the Bishop&#8217;s
son approvingly. &#8220;This is the stuff. Conventionality
be tabooed. They&#8217;re going to
the other extreme, and that&#8217;s the way to
do. If you don&#8217;t want an altar and candles,
and a high-mucky-muck at the organ, have
a hay-wagon. <i>Gee!</i>&mdash;Let me get up here
next to Ben Hur and the lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>Even the Bishop, sitting with clerical
coat-tails carefully parted, his handsome
face beaming benevolently from under his
round hat, and Mrs. Bishop, granted by
special dispensation a cushion upon the
hay seat, enjoyed that drive. Anthony,
plying a long, beribboned lash, aroused his
heavy-footed steeds into an exhilarating
trot, and the hay-wagon, carrying safely its
crew of young society people in their
gayest mood, swept over the half-mile
from the station to the house like a
royal barge.</p>
<p>As they drew up a chorus of &#8220;Oh&#8217;s!&#8221; not
merely polite but sincerely surprised and
admiring, recognised the quaint beauty of
the little house. It was no commonplace
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
country home now, though the changes
wrought had been comparatively slight. It
looked as if it might have stood for years
in just this fashion, yet it was as far removed
from its primitive characterless condition
as may be an artist&#8217;s drawing of a face upon
which he has altered but a line.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dingley and Mr. Horatio Marcy&mdash;a
pair whose presence anywhere would have
been a voucher for the decorum of the
most unconventional proceedings&mdash;welcomed
the party upon the wide, uncovered
porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be married very soon, to
have it over,&#8221; called Anthony. &#8220;But you
may explore the house first, so your minds
shall be at rest during the crisis. Just
don&#8217;t wander too far away in examining
this ancestral mansion. There are six
rooms. I should advise your going in line,
otherwise complications may occur in the
upper hall. Please don&#8217;t all try to get into
the kitchen at once; it can&#8217;t be done. It
will hold Juliet and me at the same time&mdash;all
the rooms have been stretched to do
that&mdash;they had to be; but I&#8217;m not sure as to
their capacity for more. Now make yourselves
absolutely at home. The place is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
yours&mdash;for a few hours. After that it&#8217;s
mine&mdash;and Juliet&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced, laughing, at his bride, as he
spoke from where he stood in the doorway.
She was on the little landing of the staircase,
at the opposite end of the living-room. She
looked down and across at him, and nearly
everybody in the room&mdash;they were thronging
through at the moment&mdash;caught that
glance. She was smiling back at him, and
her eyes lingered only an instant after they
met his, but her friends all saw. There
could be no question that the Juliet Marcy
who, since she had laid aside her pinafores,
had kept many men at bay, had at last
surrendered. As for Anthony&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s always been in love with
her,&#8221; said the Bishop&#8217;s son in the ear of the
best man, as in accordance with their
host&#8217;s permission they peeped admiringly
in at the little kitchen, &#8220;but any idiot can
see that he&#8217;s fairly off his feet now. Ideal
condition&mdash;eh? Say, this dining-room&#8217;s
great&mdash;Jove, it is. I&#8217;m going to get asked
out here to dinner as soon as they are back.
Let&#8217;s go upstairs. The girls are just coming
down&mdash;hear &#8217;em gurgling over what
they saw?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>Upstairs the best man looked in at the
blue-and-white room with eyes which one
with penetration might have said were
envious. Indeed, he stared at everything
with much the same expression. He was
the soberest man present. Ordinarily he
could be counted on to enliven such occasions,
but to-day his fits of hilarity were
only momentary, and during the intervals
he was observed by the Bishop&#8217;s son to be
gazing somewhat yearningly into space with
an abstraction new to him.</p>
<p>Nobody knew just how the moment for
the ceremony arrived. But when the survey
of the house was over and everybody
had instinctively come back to the living-room,
the affair was brought about most
naturally. The Bishop, at a word from the
best man, took his place in the doorway
opening upon the porch, which had been
set in a great nodding border of goldenrod.
Anthony, making his way among his guests,
came with a quiet face up to Juliet and,
bending, said softly, &#8220;Now, dear?&#8221; A hush
followed instantly, and the guests fell back
to places at the sides of the room. Anthony&#8217;s
best man was at his elbow, and the two
went over to the Bishop, to stand by his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
side. Mr. Marcy moved quietly into his
place. Juliet, with Judith, who had kept
beside her, walked across the floor, and
Anthony, meeting her, led her a step
farther to face the Bishop. It was but a
suggestion of the usual convention, and
Anthony, in his white clothes, surrounded
as he was by men in frock-coats, was
assuredly the most unconventional bridegroom
that had ever been seen. Juliet,
too, wore the simplest of white gowns, with
no other adornment than that of her own
beauty. Yet, somehow, as the guests,
grown sober in an instant, looked on and
noted these things, there was not one who
felt that either grace or dignity was lacking.
The rich voice of the Bishop was as impressive
as it had ever been in chancel or
at altar; the look on Anthony&#8217;s face was
one which fitted the tone in which he spoke
his vows; and Juliet, giving herself to the
man whose altered fortunes she was agreeing
to share, bore a loveliness which made
her a bride one would remember long&mdash;and
envy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, that&#8217;s done,&#8221; said the Bishop&#8217;s
son with a gusty sigh of relief, which brought
the laugh so necessary to the relaxing of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
the tension which accompanies such scenes.
&#8220;Jove, it&#8217;s a good thing to see a fellow like
Robeson safely tied up at last. You never
can tell where these quixotic ideas about
houses and hay-wagons and weddings may
lead. It&#8217;s a terrible strain, though, to see
people married. I always tremble like a
leaf&mdash;I weigh only a hundred and ninety-eight
now, and these things affect me.
It&#8217;s so frightful to think what might happen
if they should trip up on their specifications.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a simple wedding breakfast
served&mdash;by whom nobody could tell. It
was eaten out in the orchard&mdash;a pleasant
place, for the neglected grass had been close
cut, and an old-fashioned garden at one
side perfumed the air with late September
flowers. The trim little country maids
who brought the plates came from a willow-bordered
path which led presumably to the
next house, some distance down the road.
There were several innovations in the
various dishes, delicious to taste. Altogether
it was a little feast which everybody
enjoyed with unusual zest. And the life
of the party was the bridegroom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw a fellow able to scintillate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
like that at his own wedding,&#8221; remarked
the son of the Bishop to the best man&#8217;s
sister. &#8220;Usually they are so completely
dashed by their own temerity in getting
into such an irretrievable situation that
they sit with their ears drooping and their
eyes bleared. Do you suppose it&#8217;s getting
married in tennis clothes that&#8217;s done it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tennis clothes!&#8221; cried the best man&#8217;s
sister with a merry laugh. &#8220;If you realised
how much handsomer he looks than you
men in your frock-coats you would not
make fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make fun!&#8221; repeated the Bishop&#8217;s son
solemnly. &#8220;I joke only to keep my head
above water. I never in my life was so
completely submerged in the desire to get
married instantly and live in a picturesque
band-box. Nothing can keep me from it
longer than it takes to find the girl and the
band-box. If&mdash;if&mdash;&#8221; his voice dropped to
a whisper, and a hint of redness crept into
his face which belied his jesting words,
&#8220;you knew of the girl&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;say&mdash;should
you mind living in a band-box?&#8221;</p>
<p>The best man&#8217;s sister was the sort of girl
who can discern when even an inveterate
joker is daring to be somewhat more than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
half in earnest, and she flushed so prettily
that the son of the Bishop caught her hand
boyishly under the little table. He had
hitherto been considered a hopeless old
bachelor, so it may readily be seen that,
now the contagion had caught him, his was
quite a serious case.</p>

<p>When it was all over Judith Dearborn
went upstairs with Juliet to help her dress
for her going away. The maid-of-honour
looked about the blue-and-white room with
thoughtful eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly the dearest room I
ever saw,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, Juliet, do you
think you really will be happy here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think about it, dear?&#8221;
asked Juliet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;well, really&mdash;I never imagined
that a little old house like this could be
made so awfully attractive. But, Juliet&mdash;you&mdash;you
must be very, very fond of Anthony
to give up so many things. How
well he looked to-day. Seems to me he&#8217;s
grown gloriously in every way since he&mdash;since
his family came into so many misfortunes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet smiled, but answered nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re so different, too. Never in
my life would I have imagined you having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
a wedding like this&mdash;and yet it&#8217;s been
absolutely the prettiest one I ever saw.
That&#8217;s a sweet gown to go away in&mdash;but
it&#8217;s the simplest thing you ever wore, I&#8217;m
sure. Juliet, where are you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to drive through the
Berkshires in a cart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet Marcy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Robeson,&#8217;&#8221; corrected Juliet with a
little laugh, but in a tone which it was a
pity Anthony could not hear. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
forget that. I&#8217;m so proud of the name.
And I think a drive through the Berkshires
will be a perfectly ideal trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith Dearborn was not assisting the
bride at all. Instead she was sitting in a
chair, staring at Juliet with much the same
abstraction of manner observable in the
best man throughout the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you didn&#8217;t need to live this
way,&#8221; observed Miss Dearborn at length.
&#8220;You could have afforded to live much
more expensively.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Juliet with a flash
in her eyes, though she smiled; &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
have afforded to do one thing that would
hurt Tony&#8217;s pride. Why, Judith&mdash;he&#8217;s a
&#8216;Robeson of Kentucky.&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he looks it,&#8221; admitted Judith.
&#8220;And you&#8217;re a Marcy of Massachusetts.
The two go well together. Juliet, do you
know&mdash;somehow&mdash;I thought it was a fearful
sacrifice you were making, even for such
a man as Anthony&mdash;but&mdash;this blue-and-white
room&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, this blue-and-white room&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; repeated
Juliet. Then she came over and
dropped on her knees by her friend in her
impulsive way and put both arms around
her. The plain little going-away gown
touched folds with the one whose elegance
was equalled only by its cost. Anthony
Robeson&#8217;s wife looked straight up into the
eyes of her maid-of-honour and whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith, don&#8217;t put Wayne&mdash;and&mdash;your
blue-and-white room off too long. You
will not be any happier to wait&mdash;if you love
him.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Drawn up close to the door stood the
cart. Beside it waited Anthony. Around
the cart crowded twenty people. When
Juliet came through them to say good-bye
the son of the Bishop murmured:</p>
<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;Mrs. Robeson&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Farnham&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; said Juliet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
promptly, her delicate flush answering the
name, as it had answered it many times
that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;When are you going to be at home to
your friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fifteenth day of October,&#8221; said
Juliet. &#8220;And from then on, every day in
the week, every week in the year. Come
and see us&mdash;everybody. But don&#8217;t expect
any formal invitations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be down,&#8221; declared the Bishop&#8217;s
son. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be down once a week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t stay long after we are
gone,&#8221; requested Anthony, putting his bride
into the cart and springing in beside her.
He gathered up the reins. &#8220;Good-bye,&#8221;
he called. &#8220;Take this next train home.
It goes in an hour. Lock the door, Carey,
and hang the key up in plain sight by the
window there. We live in the country now,
and that&#8217;s the way we do. Good-bye&mdash;good-bye!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he drove rapidly away down the
road.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that pair,&#8221; said the son of the
Bishop gravely, looking after them and
speaking to the company in general, &#8220;married,
so to speak, in a hay-wagon, and going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
for a wedding trip in a wheel-barrow
through the Berkshires, is Juliet Marcy and
Anthony Robeson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my son,&#8221; said the Bishop slowly&mdash;and
everybody always listened when the
Bishop spoke: &#8220;It is Anthony and Juliet
Robeson&mdash;and that makes all the difference.
I think two happier young people I never
married. And may God be with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The best man said that he and the maid-of-honour
would walk the half-mile to the
station. The son of the Bishop and the
sister of the best man had already taken
this course without saying anything about
it. Nearly everybody murmured something
about it being a lovely evening and
a glorious sunset and a charming road, and,
pairing off advisedly, adopted the same
plan. The Bishop and Mrs. Bishop, Mrs.
Dingley and Mr. Marcy decided on being
driven over to the station in a light surrey
provided for this anticipated emergency.</p>
<p>The best man and the maid-of-honour
succeeded in dropping behind the rest of
the pedestrians. Their friends were used
to that, and let them mercifully alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty pretty affair,&#8221; observed Carey
in a melancholy tone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;in its way,&#8221; admitted Judith
Dearborn with apparent reluctance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cosy house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony seemed happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ecstatic.&#8221; Judith&#8217;s inflection was peculiar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody would have suspected Juliet of
feeling blue about living off here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t seem to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s made the difference?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthony Robeson, probably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must seem pretty good to him to have
her care like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t everybody that could inspire
such an&mdash;affection&mdash;in such a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carey looked intensely gloomy. The
two walked on in silence, Miss Dearborn
studying the sunset, Carey studying Miss
Dearborn. Suddenly he spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith, do all our plans for the future
seem as desirable to you as they did this
morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which ones?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apartment in the locality we&#8217;ve picked
out&mdash;life in the style the locality calls for&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
<i>wait</i> for it all until I&#8217;m <i>gray</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; with
a burst of tremendous energy. &#8220;Good
heavens, darling, what&#8217;s the use? Why&mdash;if
I could have you and a little home like
that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He bit his lip hard. The maid-of-honour
walked on, her head turned still farther
away than before. They were nearing the
station. Just ahead lay a turn in the road&mdash;the
last turn. The rest of the party,
with a shout back at this dilatory pair, disappeared
around it. From the distance
came the long, shrill whistle of the approaching
train.</p>
<p>The maid-of-honour glanced behind:
there was not a soul in sight; ahead: and
saw nothing to alarm a girl with an impulse
in her heart. At a point where great
masses of reddening sumac hid a little dip
in the road from everything earthly she
stopped suddenly, and turning, put out
both hands. She looked up into a face
which warmed on the instant into a half-incredulous
joy and said very gently:
&#8220;You may.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The sun had been gone only two hours,
and the soft early autumn darkness had but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
lately settled down upon the silent little
house, waiting alone for its owners to come
back some October day, when a cart, driven
slowly, rolled along the road. In front of
the house it stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are we?&#8221; asked Juliet&#8217;s voice.
&#8220;This is a private house. I thought we&mdash;Why,
Tony&mdash;do you see?&mdash;We&#8217;ve come
around in a circle instead of going on to that
little inn you spoke of. This is&mdash;<i>home</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; said Anthony&#8217;s voice in a tone
of great surprise. &#8220;So it is!&#8221; He leaped
out and came around to Juliet&#8217;s side.
&#8220;What a fluke!&#8221; But the happy laugh in
his voice betrayed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthony Robeson,&#8221; cried Juliet softly,
&#8220;you need not pretend to be surprised.
You meant to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221; He reached out both arms to
take her down. &#8220;Perhaps I did. Do you
mind&mdash;Mrs. Robeson? Shall we go on?&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet looked down at him. &#8220;No, I
don&#8217;t think I mind,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He swung her down, and they went
slowly up the walk. &#8220;Somehow,&#8221; said
Anthony Robeson, looking up at the house,
lying as if asleep in the September night,
&#8220;when I thought of taking you to that little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
public inn, and then remembered that we
might have this instead&mdash;We can go on
with our wedding journey to-morrow, dear-but&mdash;to-night&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He led her silently upon the porch. He
found the key, where in jest he had bade
his best man put it, and unlocked the door
and threw it open.</p>
<p>He stepped first upon the threshold, and,
turning, held out his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he said, smiling in the darkness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>XI.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Bachelor at Dinner</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hallo there&mdash;Anthony Robeson&mdash;don&#8217;t
be in such a hurry you can&#8217;t notice a fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big figure rushing through the snow
paused, wheeled, and thrust out a hand of
hearty greeting. &#8220;That you, Carey? Hat
over your eyes like a train robber&mdash;electric
lights all behind you&mdash;and you expect me
to smile at you as I go by! How are you?
How&#8217;s Judith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Infernally lonely&mdash;I mean I am&mdash;Judith&#8217;s
off on a visit to her mother. Say,
Tony&mdash;take me home with you&mdash;will you?
I want some decent things to eat, so I&#8217;m
holding you up on purpose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good&mdash;come on. Train goes in a few
minutes. Juliet will be delighted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two hurried on together into the
station from which the suburban trains
were constantly leaving. As they entered
they encountered a mutual friend, at
whom both flung themselves enthusiastically
with alternate greetings:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Roger Barnes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger&mdash;old fellow&mdash;glad to see you
back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patient safely landed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get a big fee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take him home with us, Tony&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
The third man looked smiling at Tony.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll challenge you to,&#8221; said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy&mdash;come on,&#8221; responded
Anthony Robeson with cordiality. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
just telephone Mrs. Robeson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; said Dr. Roger Barnes.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t dare not to. I understand.
Go ahead. But if she&#8217;s too much dashed
let me know, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony turned, laughing, into a telephone
closet, from which he emerged in time
to catch his train with his guests.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he assured them. &#8220;But
it&#8217;s only fair to let her know a few minutes
ahead. You like to understand, Roger,
before you start, don&#8217;t you, whether your
emergency case is a hip-fracture or a cut
lip, so you can tell whether to take your
glue or your sewing-silk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means,&#8221; said the bachelor of the
party. &#8220;And I suppose you think Mrs. Juliet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
Marcy Robeson is now smiling happily to
herself over this little surprise. I&#8217;ll lay you
anything you please that if I can make her
own up she&#8217;ll admit that she said &#8216;<i>Merciful
heavens!</i>&#8217; into the telephone when she got
your message.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony shook his head. &#8220;Evidently
you don&#8217;t know what guests in the remote
suburbs on a stormy February night mean
to a poor girl whose nearest neighbour is
five hundred feet away. Your ideas of
married life need a little freshening, too.
They&#8217;re pretty antique.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a half-mile from the station to the
house&mdash;the &#8220;box of a house&#8221;&mdash;which had
been Anthony&#8217;s home for five months, and
toward which he now led his friends with
the air of a man about to show his most
treasured possessions. He strode through
the deepening snow as if he enjoyed the
strenuous tramp, setting a pace which
Wayne Carey, with his office life, if not the
doctor, more vigorously built and bred,
found difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; called the leader, pointing
toward windows glowing with a ruddy light.
The doctor looked up with interest. Carey
was a frequent visitor, but the busy surgeon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
old school-and-college chum of
Anthony&#8217;s though he was, was about to
have his first introduction to a place of
which he had heard much, but of whose
nearness to Paradise he doubted with the
strong skepticism of a man who has seen
many a fair beginning end in all unhappiness
and desolation.</p>
<p>As they stamped upon the little porch
the door flew open, the brilliancy and
comfort of a fire-and-lamplit room leaped
out at them, a delicious faint odour of
cookery assailed their hungry nostrils, and
the welcome which makes all worth having
met them on the threshold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wayne,&#8221; said the rich young voice of
the mistress of the house, &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad.
Roger Barnes, this is just downright good
of you; it&#8217;s so long you&#8217;ve promised us this.
Tony&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>What she said to Tony must have been
whispered in his ear if voiced at all, for the
two guests, looking on with laughing,
envious eyes, saw their hostess swept
unceremoniously into a bearlike embrace,
swung into the air as one thrusts up a
child, poised there an instant, laughing
and protesting, then slowly lowered to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
kissed, and set down once more lightly
upon the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right. I didn&#8217;t tumble your
hair a bit,&#8221; said Anthony coolly. &#8220;Excuse
me, gentlemen, but Wayne understands&mdash;and
Roger will some day, I hope&mdash;that a
man who has been thinking about it all the
way home can&#8217;t put it off on account of a
couple of idiots who stand and stare instead
of politely turning their backs. Oh, don&#8217;t
mention it&mdash;it doesn&#8217;t disturb me at all;
and Mrs. Robeson is becoming reconciled to
my impetuosity by degrees. Make yourselves
at home, boys. Juliet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take them upstairs, Tony, please. Of
course we can&#8217;t let them go back to-night,
now we have them. It&#8217;s beginning to
storm heavily, isn&#8217;t it? I thought so.
Take them to the guest-room, Tony&mdash;and
dinner will be served as soon as you are
down.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;By Jupiter, I believe she means it,&#8221; declared
the doctor, with approval, as the
door of the bedroom closed on his host.
&#8220;I think I can tell when a woman is shamming.
She&#8217;s improved, hasn&#8217;t she, tremendously?
Pretty girl always, but&mdash;well&mdash;bloomed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
now. Nice little house. Believe
I&#8217;ll have to stay, though I ought not&mdash;just
to take observations on Tony. His
enthusiasm has all the appearance of
reality. In fact, it strikes me he has
rather&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was on his lips to say &#8220;rather more than
you have,&#8221; but it occurred to him in time
that jokes on this ground are dangerous.
Wayne Carey had been married in November,
was living in a somewhat unpretentious
way in a downtown boarding-house, and
certainly had to-night so much of a lost-dog
air that it made the doctor pause. So he
substituted: &#8220;&mdash;rather more than I should
have expected, even of a fellow who has got
the girl he has wanted all his life,&#8221; and fell
to washing and brushing vigorously, eyeing
meanwhile the little room with a critical
bachelor&#8217;s appreciation of beauty and comfort
in the quarters he is to occupy. It was
very simply furnished, certainly, but it
struck him as a place where his dreams
were likely to be pleasant for every reason
in the world.</p>
<p>Downstairs, Juliet, in the dining-room,
was surveying her table with the hostess&#8217;s
satisfaction. Opposite her stood a tall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
and slender girl, black-haired, black-eyed,
with a face of great attractiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish, Mrs. Robeson,&#8221; she was saying
eagerly, &#8220;you would let me serve you
as your maid, and not make a guest
of me. Really, I should love to do it.
I don&#8217;t need to meet your friends, and I
don&#8217;t mind seeming what I really am&mdash;your&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rachel Redding,&#8221; Juliet interrupted,
lifting an affectionate glance across the
table, &#8220;if you want to seem what you really
are&mdash;my friend&mdash;you will let me do as I
like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My shabby clothes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; murmured the
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could look as much like a princess as
you do in them&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Robeson, in that lovely dull red
you&#8217;re a queen&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;dowager,&#8221; finished Juliet gayly.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be proud of you, and you can be
proud of me, if you like, and together we&#8217;ll
make those hungry men think there&#8217;s
nothing like us. The dinner&#8217;s the thing.
Isn&#8217;t it the luckiest chance in the world I
sent for those oysters this morning? Doctor
Barnes is perfectly fine, but he never would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
believe in the happiness of married life if
the coffee were poor or the beefsteak too
much broiled. Doesn&#8217;t the table look
pretty? Those red geranium blossoms you
brought me give it just the gay touch it
needed this winter night.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Three men, standing about the wide fireplace,
warming cold hands at its friendly
blaze, turned expectantly as their youthful
hostess came in, followed by a graceful girl
in gray. Juliet presented her guests with
the air of conferring upon them a favour,
and they seemed quite ready to accept it as
such.</p>
<p>Anthony looked on with interest to see
a person whom he had known hitherto only
as a pretty but poor young neighbour
whom Juliet had engaged to help her for a
certain part of every day, introduced as his
wife&#8217;s friend, and greeted by Doctor Barnes
and Wayne Carey with quite evident admiration
and pleasure. He looked hard at
her, as Carey seated her, noticing for the
first time that she was really worth consideration,
and remembering vaguely that
Juliet had more than once tried to impress
him with the fact. If it had not been for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
the other fellows, with whose eyes as their
host he was now stimulated to observe her,
he might have been still some time longer
in coming to the realisation that Juliet had
found somebody in whom her genuine
interest was not misplaced. But Anthony
Robeson had all his life been singularly
blind to the fascinations of most other
women than Juliet. As he turned his keen
gaze from Rachel Redding to the charming
figure that sat on the other side of the
table the satisfaction in his eyes became
so pronounced that it could mean, Dr.
Roger Barnes admitted to himself, as he
caught it, nothing less than a very real
happiness.</p>
<p>It was not an elaborate dinner. It was
not by any means the sort of dinner Juliet
might have prepared had she known that
morning whom she was to entertain. It
was merely a dinner planned with affectionate
care to please and satisfy one
hungry man who liked good things to eat&mdash;and
amplified as much as possible in
quantity after Anthony&#8217;s message reached
her. And by that admirable collusion
between hostess and feminine friend which
can sometimes be effected when the situation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
demands it, the dinner prepared for three
seemed ample for five.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-109.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 512px; height: 329px;' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 512px;'>
&#8220;Three men, standing about the wide fireplace ... turned expectantly as their youthful hostess came in, followed by a graceful girl in gray.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Between them Juliet and Rachel Redding
served the various dishes and changed the
plates which Anthony handed from his
place. It was gracefully done and so
simply that the absence of a maid was a
thing to be enjoyed rather than regretted.
When Juliet, in the softly sweeping dull-red
frock which made of her a warm picture for
a winter&#8217;s night, slipped from her chair and
moved about the room, or brought in from
the kitchen a steaming dish, she seemed the
ideal hostess, herself bestowing what her own
hands had prepared. And when Rachel
Redding offered a man a cup of fragrant
coffee, smiling down in the general direction
of his uplifted face without meeting his
eyes, there was certainly nothing lost from
his enjoyment of the beverage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, but this dinner has tasted just
about right,&#8221; was Wayne Carey&#8217;s satisfied
observation as he leaned back in his chair
at last, after draining his third cup of
coffee&mdash;and the pot itself, if he had but
known it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Went to the spot?&#8221; asked Anthony,
leaning back also with the expression of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the friendly host. He was young to cultivate
that expression, but he appeared
to find no difficulty about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It did&mdash;every last mouthful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. Now, if you fellows will come
back to the fire and have a pipeful of talk
we shall not be missed. In this house on
ordinary occasions we reverse the order of
after-dinner privileges&mdash;the men retire to
the atmosphere of the sofa-pillows, and the
women&mdash;I&#8217;m not allowed to tell what they
do. But after remaining discreetly out of
sight for some little time, during which faint
sounds as of the rattle of china penetrate
through closed doors, they reappear, pleasantly
flushed and full of a sort of relieved
joy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what I wish,&#8221; said Roger Barnes,
looking back from the dining-room doorway
at young Mrs. Robeson; &#8220;I wish that when
the dishes are all ready you would let me
know. I should like nothing better than
to have a dish-towel at them. I know all
about it&mdash;my mother taught me how.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked so precisely as if he meant it,
and the glance he sent past Juliet at Rachel
Redding was so suggestive of his dislike
to be separated for the coming hour from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
the feminine portion of the household, that
his hostess answered promptly: &#8220;Of course
you may. We never refuse an offer like
that. We will try you&mdash;on promise of good
behaviour.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XII.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>The Bachelor Begs a Dish-Towel</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When the door closed on the three Juliet
produced from somewhere two aprons&mdash;attractive
affairs on the pinafore order&mdash;one
of which she slipped upon Rachel, the
other donned herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are my kitchen party-aprons,&#8221;
she said gayly, noting how the pretty garment
became the girl, &#8220;calculated to impress
the masculine mind with the charm
of domesticity in women. The doctor needs
a little illustrated lesson of the sort. Life
in boarding-houses isn&#8217;t adapted to encourage
a man in the belief that real comfort is
to be found anywhere outside of a bachelor&#8217;s
club.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before he was called the doctor forsook a
half-smoked cigar and the seductive hollows
of Anthony&#8217;s easiest chair and marched
briskly out to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see I distrust you,&#8221; he announced,
putting in his head at the door. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid you will get them all done without
me.&#8221;

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. Here you are,&#8221; and
Juliet tied a big white apron about a large-sized
waist. &#8220;Here&#8217;s your towel. No,
don&#8217;t touch the glass; a man is too unconscious
of his strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A surgeon?&#8221; demurred Rachel softly,
from over her steaming dishpan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Miss Redding,&#8221; said the
doctor, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, how stupid of me,&#8221; Juliet made
amends swiftly. &#8220;Miss Redding remembers
that when I got my telephone message
to-night I told her that the most distinguished
young specialist in the city was
coming here to dinner. A hand trained
to such delicate tasks as those of surgery&mdash;here,
Dr. Roger Barnes, forgive me, and
wipe my most precious goblets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have my nerves unsteady with
such speeches as that,&#8221; said he, but he
accepted the trust. He held the goblets and
the other daintily cut and engraved pieces
of glass with evident pleasure in the task.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Juliet and Rachel made rapid
work of the greater part of the dishes,
handling thin china with the dexterity of
housewives who love their work&mdash;and their
china. Talk and laughter flowed brightly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
through it all, and when the doctor had
finished his glass he looked disappointed at
seeing not much left to do. At the moment
Rachel was scrubbing and scraping a big
baking-dish, portions of whose surface
strongly resisted her efforts, in spite of previous
soaking. The assistant, looking about
him for new worlds to conquer, fell upon this
dish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, here,&#8221; said he, &#8220;let me have it.
I&#8217;ll use on it some of the unconscious
strength Mrs. Robeson credits me with.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Rachel clung to the dish. &#8220;Proper
housekeepers,&#8221; she averred, &#8220;always say
&#8216;That&#8217;s all, thank you,&#8217; as soon as the china
is done, and finish the pots and kettles
after the guest has gone back to pleasanter
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Did you ever have a man for
dish-wiper before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never a surgeon,&#8221; admitted Miss Redding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t appreciate the fact
that a man likes to do big things which
make the most show and get the credit for
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the dish away from her by a
dexterous little twist in which conscious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
strength certainly asserted itself. Rachel,
laughing, with a dash of colour in cheeks
which were normally of dark ivory tints,
accepted the dish-towel he handed her.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Hallo, there,&#8221; cried Wayne Carey&#8217;s voice
from the door. &#8220;You&#8217;re having more fun
out here than we are in there, and that&#8217;s
not fair. The lord of the manor is getting
so chesty over the delights of a country
home in a February snowbank that he&#8217;s
becoming heavy company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No room for you here,&#8221; returned the
doctor, removing with a flourish the last
candied sugar lump from the bottom of the
big dish, and beginning to swash about
vigorously in the hot water. &#8220;We do something
besides talk out here; we work. Our
kitchen is so small we have to waste no
time in steps; as we dry the things we chuck
them straight into their places.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suiting the action to the word he caught
up a shining cake-tin and cast it straight at
Carey. That gentleman dodged, but Anthony
caught it, performed upon it an
imitation of the cymbals, then turned about
and laid it in a nest of similar tins upon a
shelf in an open closet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but I&#8217;m well trained,&#8221; he boasted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were you wouldn&#8217;t put it away
wet,&#8221; observed Rachel slyly.</p>
<p>Anthony withdrew the tin, wiped it with
much solicitude, and replaced it.</p>
<p>&#8220;These little technicalities are beyond
me,&#8221; he apologised. &#8220;Your real athlete in
kitchen work is your scientific man. See
him dry that bean-pot with the glass-towel.
Now, I know better than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away, all of you,&#8221; commanded the
mistress of the place. &#8220;Go back to the
fire and we&#8217;ll join you. If you are very
good we&#8217;ll bring you a special treat by-and-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles it,&#8221; said the doctor, and
led the retreat, but not without a backward
glance at the little kitchen.</p>
<p>Juliet had gone into the dining-room
with a trayful of glass and silver. Rachel
Redding was plunging half a dozen white
towels into a pan of steaming water. Barnes
stood an instant, staring hard at the slender
figure in the white pinafore, the round young
arms gleaming in the lamplight&mdash;then he
turned to follow the others. There are
some pictures which linger long in a man&#8217;s
memory; why, he can hardly tell. With
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
all his varied experiences Dr. Roger Barnes
had never before discovered how attractive
a background a well-kept kitchen makes
for a beautiful woman, so that she be there
mistress of the situation. Long after he
had gone back to the fire his absent eyes,
while the others talked, were studying the&mdash;to
him&mdash;unaccustomed and singularly
charming scene he had just left in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>When Juliet and Rachel came in at length
they found a plan afoot for their entertainment.
Wayne Carey was standing at the
window showing cause why the whole party
should go out and coast upon the hill near
by.</p>
<p>&#8220;You admit,&#8221; he argued with Anthony,
&#8220;that you know where we can get a pair
of bobs&mdash;and if you can&#8217;t I&#8217;ll bribe some of
those youngsters out there to let us have
theirs. The storm has stopped; the boys
have swept off the whole hill, I should judge,
by the way their track shines again under
the moonlight. I haven&#8217;t had a good coast
since I left college.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to Juliet. &#8220;Will you go?&#8221; he
asked coaxingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we will,&#8221; promised Juliet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
&#8220;Tony wants to go&mdash;he&#8217;s just enjoying making
you tease. As for the doctor&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If my right hand has not forgot her cunning,&#8221;
he agreed.</p>
<p>In ten minutes the party was off. A
young matron of five months&#8217; standing is
not so materially changed from the girl she
used to be that she can fail to be the gayest
of company, perhaps with the more zest
that the old good times seem a bit far away
already and she is glad to bring them back.</p>
<p>As for the real girl of the party, in this
case it chanced to be a country lass who had
been away to school and half-way through
college, had been brought home by love
and duty to some elderly people who needed
her, and had known many hours of stifled
longing for the sort of companionship with
which she had grown happily familiar.</p>
<p>Matron and maid&mdash;they were a pair for
whose sakes the men who were with them
gladly made slaves of themselves to give
them an evening of glorious outdoor fun&mdash;and
at small sacrifice.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;What a night!&#8221; exulted the doctor,
striding up the long hill beside Rachel
Redding breathing deep. &#8220;I&#8217;m thanking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
all my lucky stars that they led my path
across Anthony Robeson&#8217;s to-night. I&#8217;ve
been intending to come out here ever since
he was married&mdash;and might not have done
it for another six months if I hadn&#8217;t got
started. He&#8217;ll have all he wants of me now.
It&#8217;s the most delightful spot I&#8217;ve been in for
many moons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a dear little home,&#8221; agreed Rachel
warmly. &#8220;Mrs. Robeson would make the
most commonplace house in the world one
where everybody would want to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s evident. Yet, somehow, knowing
her well as a girl, I never should have
suspected just those home-making qualities.
You didn&#8217;t know her then, I suppose?
She was a girl other girls liked heartily, and
men enthusiastically&mdash;one of the &#8216;I&#8217;ll be a
good friend, but don&#8217;t come too near&#8217; sort,
you know. But she was very fond of
travel and change, ready for everything in
the way of sport&mdash;and, well, I certainly
never saw her before in anything resembling
an apron of any description. What a delightful
article of attire an apron is, anyhow.
I think I never appreciated it before
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you never saw one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
Mrs. Robeson&#8217;s aprons. Hers are not like
other people&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She makes hers poetic, does she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She certainly does&mdash;even the ones for
baking and sweeping. Not ruffled or beribboned,
but cut with an eye to attractiveness,
and always of becoming colour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. She&#8217;s an artist&mdash;that was noticeable
in the oysters&mdash;if she made the dish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The coffee was the best I ever drank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You made that, then,&#8221; remarked the
doctor astutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad it was good,&#8221; said Rachel
demurely.</p>
<p>They had reached the top of the hill.
Doctor Barnes insisted that Anthony had
been the best steerer of coasting parties
known to the juvenile world, and placed
him at the helm. Next came Juliet, with
both arms clasped as far about her husband&#8217;s
stalwart frame as they would go.
Carey had wanted to be the end man, but
Doctor Barnes would have none of it.
&#8220;You have to take care of Mrs. Robeson,&#8221;
he said firmly, and placed him next. This
brought Miss Redding last, and Dr. Roger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
Barnes, knowing man, as hanger-on behind
upon bobs already fairly full. The last
man, as every coaster understands, has to
be alert to help out any possible bad steering,
and so keeps a watchful head thrust
half over the shoulder in front.</p>
<p>The foregoing explanation will show how
it came about that all down the long, swift
descent, Rachel, breathless with the unaccustomed
delight of the flight, felt upon
her cheek a warm breath, and was conscious
of a most extraordinary nearness
of the lips which kept saying merry things
into her ear. The ear itself grew warm
before the bottom of the track was reached.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a great coast,&#8221; cried the doctor
as they reached the end of the long slide.
&#8220;Now for another. I&#8217;m a boy again. This
beats the best thing I could have had in
town if I hadn&#8217;t run across Anthony.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they had another&mdash;and another&mdash;and
one more. Then Rachel Redding, stopping
in front of a small house which lay at the
foot of the hill, said good-night to them
and slipped away before Barnes had realised
what had happened.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Does she live there?&#8221; he questioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
Juliet, as the four who were left moved on
toward home. Anthony and Wayne were
discussing a subject on which they had
differed at the top of the hill. &#8220;Somehow,
I got the impression she lived with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but she comes over a good deal.
I couldn&#8217;t get on without her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet looked up at him. &#8220;I think it
would be better that you should know,
Roger,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and I&#8217;m sure Miss Redding
herself would prefer it&mdash;that I pay
her for several hours a day of regular work.
You&#8217;ve only to see her to understand that
she does this simply because it&#8217;s the only
thing open to her as long as her father and
mother can&#8217;t spare her to go away. She
gave up her college course in the middle
because she said they were pining to death
for her. They are in very greatly reduced
circumstances, after a lifetime of prosperity.
She&#8217;s a rare creature&mdash;I&#8217;m learning to
appreciate her more every day. She&#8217;s never
said a word about her loneliness here, but
it shows in her eyes. It&#8217;s a perfect delight
to me to have her with me, and I mean to
give her all the fun I can. For all that
demure manner and her Madonna face she&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
as full of mischief as a kitten when something
starts her off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet,&#8221; said the doctor soberly, turning
to look searchingly down at her in the
moonlight, &#8220;would you be willing to let
me come often?&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet looked up quickly. &#8220;So that you
may see her?&#8221; she asked straightforwardly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I won&#8217;t pretend it&#8217;s anything
else. I can tell you honestly that if there
were no other reason I should want to come
because of my old friendship for you and
Anthony, and because this evening in your
little home has given me a rare pleasure.
I know of no place like it. But I&#8217;ll tell you
squarely that I want the chance to meet
your friend often and at once. If I don&#8217;t
you will have other people coming out from
town&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Juliet, and something in the
way she said it made him ask quickly: &#8220;Has
that already happened? Am I too late?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;re too late,
but I know that we&#8217;ve suddenly grown
most attractive to another man from town.
If you had gone into Rachel&#8217;s home the
odour of violets would have met you at the
door. He sends them every few days.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ah!</i>&#8221; said the doctor. It was not much
of a comment, but it spoke volumes. He
had been keen before&mdash;he was determined
now. Violets&mdash;well, there were rarer flowers
than those.</p>

<p>At the house there remained for the
guests an hour before the fire, where Juliet
brought in something hot and sweet and
sour and spicy, which tasted delicious and
brought her a shower of compliments while
they drank a friendly draught to her. When
she had left them, standing in an admiring
group on the hearth-rug and wishing her
happy dreams, they settled into luxurious
positions of ease before the fire&mdash;a fire in
the last stages of red comfort before it dies
into a smoulder of torrid ashes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthony Robeson,&#8221; said Wayne Carey,
regarding the andirons fixedly over his bed-time
pipe, &#8220;you&#8217;re a happy man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony laughed contentedly. He had
thrown himself down upon the hearth-rug
with his head on a pillow pulled from the
settle, and lay flat on his back with his
hands clasped behind his neck. It was an
attitude deeply expressive of masculine
comfort.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re exactly right,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And
you would be the same if you would give
up living in that infernal boarding-house.
What do you want to fool with your first
year of married life like that for? You
told me that Judith was bowled over by
our wedding, and was ready to go in for this
sort of thing with a will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; admitted Carey, &#8220;but&#8221;&mdash;he
spoke hesitatingly&mdash;&#8220;we couldn&#8217;t seem
to find this sort of thing. You had corralled
all there was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had. Everything we looked at
was so old and mouldy, or so new and inartistic,
or so high-priced, or so far away&mdash;well,
we couldn&#8217;t seem to get at it, so we
said we&#8217;d board a while and wait until we
could look around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How does it work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I suppose it works very well,&#8221;
said Carey cautiously. &#8220;Judith seems contented.
We have as good meals as the
average in such houses, and the people are
rather a nice lot. We&#8217;re invited around
quite a good deal, and Judith likes that.
I ought to like it better than I do, somehow.
I&#8217;m so confoundedly tired when I get home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
nights I can&#8217;t help thinking of you and
Juliet here in this jolly room. There&#8217;s an
abominable blue and yellow wall-paper on
our sitting-room&mdash;and it has a way of appearing
to turn seasick in the evening under
the electrics. Sometimes I think it&#8217;s that
that makes me feel&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seasick, too?&#8221; inquired the doctor with
his professional air. He was standing with
his arm on the chimney-piece, looking alternately
down on his friends and around
the long, low room. It <i>was</i> a jolly room&mdash;the
very essence of comfort and cosiness.
It was a beautiful room, too, in a simple
way; one which satisfied his sense of harmony
in colours and fabrics&mdash;a keen sense
with him, as it is apt to be with men of his
profession.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith likes this, too, you know,&#8221; Carey
went on loyally. &#8220;She thinks it&#8217;s great.
But how to get it for ourselves&mdash;that&#8217;s
another matter. Somehow, you were
lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever happen to see,&#8221; asked
Anthony, &#8220;a photograph I took, just for
fun, of this house as it was when Juliet saw
it first? No? Well, just look in that box
on the end of the farther bookcase, will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
you? It&#8217;s near the top&mdash;there&mdash;that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lay looking up through half-closed
lashes at the two men as they studied the
photograph, the doctor leaning over Carey&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;On your word, man, did it look like
that?&#8221; cried Barnes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve heard it did,&#8221; admitted Carey;
&#8220;but I never quite believed it could have
been as bad as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who planned it all?&#8221; the doctor asked,
getting possession of the photograph as
Carey laid it down, and giving it careful
scrutiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;My little home-maker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jove&mdash;are there any more like her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re pretty rare, I understand.
Juliet has one in training&mdash;one with a good
deal of native capacity, I should judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me know when her graduation day
approaches,&#8221; remarked the doctor.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When he fell asleep that night in the
dainty guest-room Barnes was wondering
whether Mrs. Robeson got her own breakfasts,
and hoping that she certainly did not,
at least when guests were in the house. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
was down half an hour earlier than necessary,
and to his great satisfaction found a
slender figure brushing up ashes and setting
the fireplace in order for the morning fire.
As he begged leave to help he noted the
satin smoothness of Miss Redding&#8217;s heavy
black hair and the trim perfection of her
attire. She reminded him of his hospital
nurses in their immaculate blue and white.
When he saw the mistress of the house and
found her similarly dressed a certain skepticism
grew in his mind.</p>
<p>When he went out to breakfast he murmured
in Anthony&#8217;s ear: &#8220;Just tell me, old
fellow&mdash;to satisfy the curiosity of a bachelor&mdash;do
these girls of your household
always look like this in the early morning?
I know it&#8217;s mean&mdash;but you will
know how to evade me if I&#8217;m too impertinent&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony glanced from Juliet, resembling
a pink carnation in her wash frock&mdash;February
though it was&mdash;to Rachel Redding in
dark blue and white, and smiled mischievously.
&#8220;Mrs. Robeson&mdash;and Miss Redding&mdash;you
are challenged,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a fine old chump who has an awful
suspicion that maybe when there are no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
guests you come down in calico wrappers
with day-before-yesterday&#8217;s aprons on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet gave the doctor a glance which
made him pretend to shrink behind Carey
for protection. &#8220;Will you please answer
him, Tony?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;On my word and honour, Roger Barnes,
then,&#8221; said Anthony proudly, &#8220;they always
look like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the doctor left he was weighing
carefully in his mind an urgent problem:
After waiting six months before making
his first visit at the Robesons, how soon
could he decently come again?</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are yer strawberries, ma&#8217;m.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet, alone in her little kitchen, ran to
the door in dismay. She looked down at a
freckle-faced boy carrying a big basket
filled with strawberry-boxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But my order was for next Wednesday,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Pa said he cal&#8217;lated you&#8217;d ruther
have &#8217;em when they was at the best, an&#8217;
that&#8217;s now. This hot weather&#8217;s a dryin&#8217;
&#8217;em up. May not be any good ones by
Wednesday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Every housekeeper knows that if there
is one thing particularly liable to happen it
is the arrival of fruit for preserving at the
most inopportune moment of the week.
It matters little what the excuse of the
sender may be&mdash;there is always a sufficient
reason why the original date set by the
buyer has been ignored. In this case the
strawberries had been engaged from a
neighbour, and Juliet understood at once
that she must not refuse to take them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></p>
<p>She stood looking at the rows of baskets
upon the table, when the boy had placed
them there and gone whistling away. She
was in the midst of a flurry of work. It
was Saturday, and she was cooking and
baking, putting together various dishes to
be used upon the morrow. Mr. Horatio
Marcy had lately returned from abroad.
He and Mrs. Dingley were to spend the
coming Sabbath with Juliet and Anthony&mdash;the
first occasion on which Juliet&#8217;s father
should be entertained in the house. It was
an event of importance, and his daughter
meant to show him several things concerning
her fitness for her present position.</p>
<p>Rachel Redding was not available upon
this Saturday morning. Her mother had
been taken seriously ill the night before,
and Rachel had sent word that she could
not leave her. Juliet had not minded much,
although it was a day when Rachel&#8217;s help
would have been especially acceptable. As
it was, she had reached a point where her
housewifely marshalling of the day&#8217;s work
was at a critical stage. A cake had been put
into the oven. A large bowl of soup stock
had been brought from a cool retreat to
have the smooth coating of fat removed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
from its surface. Various other dishes, in
process of construction, awaited the skilled
touch of the cook.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to do them, I suppose,&#8221;
said Mrs. Robeson to herself, regarding the
strawberries with a disapproving eye. &#8220;But
<i>why</i> they had to come to-day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She went at the strawberries, wishing
she had ordered less. They were fine
berries&mdash;on top; by degrees, as the boxes
lowered, they became less fine. It seemed
desirable to separate the superior from the
inferior and treat them differently. Only
the best would do for the delectable preserve
which was to go into glasses and be
served on special occasions; the others
could be made into jam less attractive to
the eye if hardly less acceptable to the
palate. Juliet was obliged to put down
her berry-boxes every fifth minute to attend
to one or other of the various saucepans
and double-boilers upon the little range.
Her cheeks grew flushed, for the day was
hot and the kitchen hotter. It must be
admitted that her occasional glance out
over the green fields and the woods beyond
was a longing one.</p>
<p>The better selection of the berries went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
into the clear syrup in the preserving-kettle.
Juliet flew to get her glass pots
ready. She stopped to stir something in a
saucepan. She thrust some eggs into the
small ice-chest to cool them for the salad
dressing soon to be made. She kept one
eye on the clock, for the strawberry preserve
had to be timed to a minute&mdash;ten, no more,
no less. It was a strenuous hour.</p>
<p>As she dipped up the fourth ladleful of
crimson richness&mdash;translucent as a church
window&mdash;and filled the waiting jar, a peculiar
pungent odour drifted across the
fragrance of the strawberries. Juliet
dropped her ladle and pulled open the oven
door.</p>
<p>The delicate cake which she had compounded
with especial care because it was
Mrs. Dingley&#8217;s favourite, lay a blackened
ruin. Some of it had run over upon the
oven bottom and become a mass of cinders.
Juliet jerked the cake-tin out into the daylight
and shut the oven door with a slam.</p>
<p>It was at this unpropitious moment that
a figure appeared in the doorway&mdash;a tall,
slim figure, in crisp, cool, white linen. A
charming white hat surmounted Mrs. Wayne
Carey&#8217;s carefully ordered hair, a white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
parasol in her hands completed a particularly
chaste and appropriate morning toilette
for a young woman who had nothing
to do with kitchens.</p>
<p>She was regarding with interest the young
person at the range. Juliet wore one of
her characteristic working frocks, and the
big pinafore which enveloped it from head
to foot was of an attractive design. But
the morning&#8217;s flurry had set its signs upon
her, and the pinafore was not as immaculate
as it had been three hours earlier. Her
hair, curling moistly about her flushed face,
had been impatiently pushed back more
than once, and its disorder, while not unpicturesque,
was suggestive of a somewhat
perturbed mind. Her hands were pink
with strawberry juice. She looked warm,
tired, and&mdash;if the truth must be told&mdash;at
the moment not a little out of temper.
The smile with which she welcomed her
friend could hardly be said to be one of
absolute pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve come at the wrong
time,&#8221; said Judith, regretfully. &#8220;Did you
just burn something? Too bad. I suppose
all young housekeepers do that.
Where&#8217;s your&mdash;assistant?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not here to-day,&#8221; said Juliet,
ladling up strawberry preserve with more
haste than caution. Her fingers shook a
little but she kept her voice tranquil. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all right. A number of things had to be
done at once, that&#8217;s all. Please don&#8217;t stay
in this hot place. Take off your hat and
find a cool corner somewhere in the house.
I&#8217;ll be in presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mustn&#8217;t bother you. I was going to
stay for lunch with you, it was so hot in
town, but I mustn&#8217;t think of it when
you&#8217;re so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; said Juliet with
decision. &#8220;What you see before you is only
the smoke of battle. It will soon clear
away. Run off&mdash;and I&#8217;ll be with you presently.
You&#8217;ll find the late magazines in
the living-room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her tone was intended to deceive and
it was sufficiently successful. Judith was
anxious to stay. She was also interested
in the situation. She had heard much
from Wayne in praise of Juliet&#8217;s successful
housekeeping, and had seen enough of it
herself to be curious about its inner workings.
For the first time she had happened
upon a scene which would seem to indicate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
that there were phases in this sort of
domestic life less ideal than she was asked
to believe. She went back into the coolness
and quiet of the living-room with a
full appreciation of the fact that no hot
kitchens ever threatened her own peace of
mind.</p>
<p>Juliet finished her strawberry preserve,
saw that everything liable to burn was
removed to safe quarters; then deliberately
took off her apron and stole out of the
kitchen door. She went swiftly down
through the orchard to the willow-bordered
path by the brook; then, out of sight of
everything human, ran several rods down
it with a sweep of skirts which put everything
in the bird creation to flight. At a
certain pleasant spot among the willows,
sheltered from all possible observation, she
paused and flung herself down upon the
warm ground.</p>
<p>But not in any attitude of despair.
Neither did she cry tears of vexation and
weariness. She was a healthy girl, with
the perfect physical being whose poise is
not upset by so small a matter as a fatiguing
morning. Because a cake had burned, an
extra amount of work had had to be conquered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
and an unexpected guest had arrived,
her nerves were not worn to the rending
point. But, having been reared in the
belief that a breath of outdoors is the great
antidote for all physical or mental discomforts
born of confinement indoors, she had
acquired a habit of running away from her
cares at any and all times of day in precisely
this fashion&mdash;and many were the
advantages she had reaped from this somewhat
unusual course of procedure.</p>
<p>Mrs. Anthony Robeson lay upon one side,
her arm outstretched, her cheek pillowed
upon her arm. She was drawing long,
deep breaths, and looking lazily off at a
stretch of blue sky cleft in the exact centre
by one great graceful elm tree. One would
have thought she had forgotten every care
in the world, not to mention the guest from
the city waiting expectantly for her hostess
to appear. After ten minutes of this sort
of indolence the figure in the blue and white
print dress sat up, clasped both arms about
her knees and remained regarding with half
closed eyes the softly fluttering leaves of
the willows along the edge of the brook.
The hot flush died out of her cheeks; the
lips whose expression a few minutes since
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
had indicated self-control under a combination
of trying circumstances, relaxed
into their natural sweetness with a tendency
toward mirth; and her whole aspect became
that merely of the young athlete resting
from one encounter and preparing herself
for another.</p>
<p>At length she rose, shook out her skirts,
and said aloud: &#8220;Now, Judith Dearborn
Carey, I&#8217;m ready to upset your expectations.
Since you looked in at me this
morning you&#8217;ve been thinking I wished I
hadn&#8216;t&mdash;haven&#8217;t you? Well, you may just
understand that I don&#8217;t wish anything of
the sort.&#8221; And in five minutes more she
had walked in upon her guest by way of the
front door, her pretty face serene, her
hands full of pink June roses which she
threw in a fragrant mass of beauty into her
friend&#8217;s lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put those into bowls for me, will you?&#8221;
she requested. &#8220;Arrange them to suit
yourself. Aren&#8217;t they lovely? I suppose
you&#8217;re getting hungry. In half an hour
you shall be served with a very modest but,
I trust, not insufficient lunch. Would you
like hot chocolate or iced tea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Iced tea, by all means,&#8221; chose Judith,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
who, being used to the privileges of selection
from a variety of offered foods and
beverages, was apt to want what was not
set before her, when at a private table.
Juliet understood this propensity of her
friend and slyly took advantage of it. As it
happened, she knew that at the moment she
was quite out of chocolate, but she had
counted advisedly upon Judith&#8217;s choice on
a hot June day, and she smiled to herself
as she chopped ice and sliced lemon.</p>
<p>At the end of the half hour, Judith, who
found the coolness of the living-room too
delightful to allow her to keep watch of
her friend in the hot kitchen, much as she
was tempted to do so, was summoned to
an equally cool dining-room. Upon the
bare table, daintily set out upon some of
the embroidered white doilies of Juliet&#8217;s
wedding linen, was a simple lunch of a character
which appealed to the guest&#8217;s critical
appetite in a way which made her draw a
long breath of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly do have a trick of serving
things to make them taste better than
other people&#8217;s,&#8221; she acknowledged, glancing
from the little platter of broiled chicken
with its bit of parsley to the crisp fruit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
salad made up of she knew not what, but
presenting an appetising appearance&mdash;then
regarding fondly a dish of spinach, pleasingly
flanked by thin slices of boiled egg.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really too hot to eat anything very
solid,&#8221; agreed Juliet with guile. &#8220;Rachel
and I have a way of planning our lunches a
day or two ahead, so that the leftovers we
use up are not yesterday&#8217;s but the day
before&#8217;s, and we remember with surprise
how good the original dish was far back in
the past. I wish Anthony could have his
midday meal at home&mdash;though perhaps if
he did the dinners wouldn&#8217;t strike him so
happily. Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s great fun
to see a big, hearty man sit down at a table
and look at it with an expression of adoration?
Women may deride the fact as
they will, but a healthy body does demand
good things to eat, and shouldn&#8217;t be blamed
for liking them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wayne hasn&#8217;t much appetite,&#8221; said
Judith, eating away with relish. &#8220;He dislikes
the people at our table&mdash;sometimes
I think that&#8217;s why he bolts his food and
gets off in such a hurry. By the way,
Juliet, are you and Tony coming in to the
Reardons&#8217; to-night? Of course you are.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we must,&#8221; admitted Juliet
with reluctance. &#8220;We have refused a good
many things since we&#8217;ve been here, but I
did promise Mrs. Reardon we would try
to come to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little repast over, Judith offered,
with well simulated warmth, to help her
friend with the after work. But Juliet
would have none of her. She sent her
guest out into a hammock under the trees,
and despatched the business of putting the
little kitchen to rights with the celerity
of one who means to have done with it.</p>
<p>In the middle of the June afternoon
Judith awoke from a nap in the hammock
to find her hostess standing laughing beside
her, fresh in a thin gown of flowered dimity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; yawned Judith, heavily, &#8220;I must
have gone off to sleep. I was tired&mdash;I am
tireder. This is a fatiguing sort of weather&mdash;don&#8217;t
you think so? But you don&#8217;t look
it. And after all that work I found you
in! Why aren&#8217;t you used up? It <i>kills</i> me
to do things in the heat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet dropped a big blue denim pillow
on the ground and sat down upon it in a
flutter of dimity. She lifted a smiling face
and said with spirit:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Last summer I could walk miles over
a golf course twice a day and not mind it in
the least. The year before I was most of
the time on the river, rowing till I was as
strong as a girl could be. I&#8217;ve had gymnasium
work and fencing lessons and have
been brought up to keep myself in perfect
trim by my baths and exercise. What frail
thing am I that a little housework should
use me up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I know&mdash;you always did go in
for that sort of thing,&#8221; reflected Judith,
eyeing her companion&#8217;s fresh colour and
bright eyes. &#8220;I suppose I ought, but I
never cared for it&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean the baths
and all that&mdash;of course any self-respecting
woman adores warm baths. I don&#8217;t like
the cold plunges and showers you always
add on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t expect the results.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t everybody who has your energetic
temperament. I hate golf, despise
tennis, never rowed a stroke in my life, and
could no more keep house as you are doing
than I could fly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; said Juliet demurely, pretending
to consider. &#8220;What is it that you
do like to do?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You know well enough. And little
enough of it I can get now with a husband
who never cares to stir.&#8221; There was a
suspicion of bitterness in Judith&#8217;s voice.
But Juliet, ignoring it, went blithely on:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a strong conviction that one can&#8217;t
be happy without being busy. Now that
I can&#8217;t keep up my athletic sports I should
become a pale hypochondriac without these
housewifely affairs to employ me. I don&#8217;t
like to embroider. I can&#8217;t paint china.
I&#8217;m not a musician. I somehow don&#8217;t
care to begin to devote myself to clubs in
town. I love my books and the great outdoors&mdash;and
plenty of action.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a strange girl,&#8221; was Judith&#8217;s
verdict, getting languidly out of the hammock,
an hour later, after an animated discussion
with her friend on various matters
touching on the lives of both. &#8220;Either
you&#8217;re a remarkable actress or you&#8217;re as
contented as you seem to be. I wish I had
your enthusiasm. Everything bores me&mdash;Look
at this frock, after lying in a hammock!
Isn&#8217;t white linen the prettiest thing when
you put it on and the most used up when
you take it off, of any fabric known to the
shops?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is, indeed. But if anybody can
afford to wear it it&#8217;s you, who never sit
recklessly about on banks and fences, but
keep cool and correct and stately and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;discontented. I admit I&#8217;ve talked
like a fractious child all day. But I&#8217;ve
had a good time and want to come oftener
than I have. May I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you may. Must you go?
I&#8217;ll keep you to dinner and send for Wayne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an angel, but I&#8217;ve an engagement
for five o&#8217;clock, and there&#8217;s the Reardons&#8217;
this evening. You won&#8217;t forget that? You
and Anthony will be sure to come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not promise absolutely, but I&#8217;ll see.
Mrs. Reardon was so kind as to leave it
open. It&#8217;s an informal affair, I believe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Informal, but very gorgeous, just the
same. She wouldn&#8217;t give anybody but you
such an elastic invitation as that, and you
should appreciate her eagerness to get
you,&#8221; declared Judith, who cared very
much from whom her invitations came and
could never understand her friend&#8217;s careless
attitude toward the most impressive
of them.</p>
<p>Juliet watched her guest go down the
street, and waved an affectionate hand at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
her as Judith looked back from her seat in
the trolley car. &#8220;Poor old Judy,&#8221; she
said to herself. &#8220;How glad you are you&#8217;re
not I!&mdash;And how very, very glad I am I&#8217;m
not you!&#8221;</p>
<p>An observation, it must be admitted,
essentially feminine. No man is ever heard
to felicitate himself upon the fact that he is
not some other man.</p>

<h2>XV.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Anthony Plays Maid</span></h2>
</div>

<p>After dinner that night, Juliet, having
once more put things in order and slipped
off the big pinafore which had kept her
spotless, joined her husband in the garden
up and down which he was comfortably
pacing, hands in pockets, pipe in mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jolly spot, isn&#8217;t it? Come and perambulate,&#8221;
he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just for a minute. Tony, are we going
to the Reardons?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood still and considered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know. Are we? Did you accept?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On condition that you felt like it. I
represented you as coming home decidedly
fagged these hot nights and not always
caring to stir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wise schemer! I don&#8217;t mind the aspersion
on my physical being. She urged,
I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did. I don&#8217;t know why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221; Anthony smiled down at his
wife. &#8220;Everybody is a bit curious about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
us these days. Your position, you see, is
considered very extraordinary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Tony. Shall we go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly we&#8217;d better, though it racks
my soul to think of dressing. The less I
wear my festive garments the less I want
to. For that very reason, suppose we
discipline ourselves and go. Do you mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. We&#8217;ll have to dress at once,
for it&#8217;s nearly eight now, and by the time
we have caught a train and got to Hollyhurst&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure. Here goes, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half an hour later Anthony, wrestling
with a refractory cuff button, looked up
to see his wife at his elbow. She was very
nearly a vision of elegance and beauty;
the lacking essential was explained to him
by a voice very much out of breath and a
trifle petulant:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you care anything for me, Tony, stop
everything and hook me up. I&#8217;m all
mixed up, and I can&#8217;t reach, and I&#8217;m sure
I&#8217;ve torn that little lace frill at the back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Where do I begin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Under my left arm, I think&mdash;I can&#8217;t
possibly see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither can I.&#8221; He was poking about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
under the lifted arm, among folds of filmy
stuff. &#8220;Here we are&mdash;no, we aren&#8217;t. Does
this top hook go in this little pocket on the
other side?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so&mdash;can&#8217;t you tell whether it
does by the look?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems a bit blind to me,&#8221; murmured
Anthony, struggling.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s meant to be blind&mdash;it mustn&#8217;t show
when it&#8217;s fastened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly doesn&#8217;t now. Hold on&mdash;don&#8217;t
wriggle. I&#8217;ve got it now. I&#8217;ve found
the combination. Three turns to the right,
five to the left, clear around once, then&mdash;Hullo!
I&#8217;ve come out wrong. The thing
doesn&#8217;t track at the bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve missed a hook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. I hung onto &#8217;em all the way
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you missed an eye. You&#8217;ll have
to unhook it all and begin again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony obeyed. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t
have to get into my clothes around the
corner this way,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;Here
you are. We stuck to the schedule this
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, dear. You haven&#8217;t fastened the
shoulder. There are ever so many little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
hooks along there and around the arm
hole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say there were. What&#8217;s the
good of so many?&mdash;Where do they begin?
Look out&mdash;wait a minute&mdash;Juliet, if you
don&#8217;t stop twisting around so I never can
do it. I can do great, heroic acts, it&#8217;s
the little trials that floor me&mdash;There&mdash;no!&mdash;that
doesn&#8217;t look right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet ran to the mirror. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
right,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Look&mdash;that corner
shouldn&#8217;t lap over like that. Oh, if I could
only reach myself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8216;t&mdash;I&#8217;ve often tried it. The
human anatomy&mdash;Stand still, Julie&mdash;you&#8217;re
getting nervous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s trying&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
murmured Juliet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you let your dressmakers build
your frocks this way? Why not get into
&#8217;em all in front, where you can see what
you&#8217;re doing?&mdash;Now I&#8217;ve got it. Isn&#8217;t that
right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Wait, Tony&mdash;here&#8217;s the girdle.
It fastens behind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony surveyed the incomprehensible
affair of silk and velvet ribbon she put into
his hands. &#8220;Looks like a head-stall to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
me,&#8221; he said. Juliet laughed and fitted it
about her own waist. Anthony attempted
to make it join at the back of the points
she held out to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t come together,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it will. Draw it tight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am drawing it tight. It&#8217;s smaller
than you are. You can&#8217;t wear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet laughed again. Anthony tugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till I hold my breath,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Great guns!</i>&#8221; he ejaculated, and by
the exertion of much force fastened the
girdle. Then he stood off a step or two
and looked at his wife curiously. Flushed
and laughing she returned his gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you breathe?&#8221; he asked solicitously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What with?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a little tight, of course,&#8221; she
admitted. &#8220;This is one of my trousseau
dresses. I&#8217;ve grown a little stouter, I suppose.
Never mind, I can stand it for to-night.
Thank you very much. You must
hurry now, Tony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t had my pay for playing
maid,&#8221; he said, and came close. He surveyed
his wife&#8217;s fair neck and shoulders,
turned her around and deliberately kissed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
the soft hollow where the firm white flesh
of her neck met the waving brown hair
drawn lightly upwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the spot that tantalized me for
about six years,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>Hunting hurriedly through various
drawers and boxes in the blue-and-white
room, in search of gloves and fan, Juliet
heard her husband come in his turn to her
open door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you have the goodness to look at
me?&#8221; he requested, in a melancholy voice.
Juliet turned, gave him one glance, and
broke into a merry peal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Tony!&mdash;What&#8217;s the matter? Have
you been growing stouter, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be,&#8221; he said solemnly.</p>
<p>His clawhammer coat was so tight across
the shoulders that the strain was evident.
He was holding his arms in the exaggerated
position of the small boy who wears a last
year&#8217;s suit. Juliet revolved around her
husband&#8217;s well built figure with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It does look tight,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
have you grown heavier all at once? It
can&#8217;t be long since you wore that coat
before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe I have for months. It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
been altogether frock-coats and informals.
I haven&#8217;t been to an evening affair with
ladies for a good while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look as it feels, I&#8217;m sure.
It&#8217;s getting very late&mdash;we ought to be off,&#8221;
and Juliet gathered up her belongings and
gave him a long loose coat to hold for her
which covered her finery completely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&#8217;s the hour when I regret that I
haven&#8217;t a carriage for you,&#8221; said Anthony,
as they descended the stairs. He got into
his outer coat reluctantly. &#8220;I shall split
something around my back before the
evening is over,&#8221; he prophesied resignedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind. Remember how tight my
girdle is. It grows tighter every minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>They got out upon the porch and Anthony
locked the door. &#8220;If I should show
that door-key to any man I know except
Carey he would howl,&#8221; he remarked, holding
up the queer old brass affair before he
slipped it into his pocket. He looked
down at Juliet in the gathering June twilight.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you wish we didn&#8217;t have to
go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do,&#8221; she agreed frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy! At this hour?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We could telephone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t you feel rather ashamed to,
so late?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit. But of course we&#8217;ll go if you
say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed, and he joined her boyishly.
She hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I see you looking faint in that girdle
shall I throw a glass of cold water over
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do. If I hear a sound as of
rending cloth shall I divert the attention of
the company?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were laughing like two children.
Anthony sat down in one of the porch
chairs. He drew a long sigh. &#8220;I never
hated to leave my dear home so since I
came into it,&#8221; he said gloomily.</p>
<p>Juliet pulled off her coat. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll
do the telephoning I&#8217;ll stay,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He jumped to his feet. &#8220;Let me loosen
that girdle for you. I haven&#8217;t been breathing
below the fifth rib myself since you put
it on, just in sympathy,&#8221; he declared.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;The trouble is,&#8221; said Anthony Robeson,
shifting his position on the step below
Juliet so that he could rest his head against
her knee, &#8220;the trouble is we&#8217;re getting too
popular.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet laughed and ran her fingers through
his thick locks, gently tweaking them. The
two were alone together in the warm darkness
of a July evening, upon their own little
porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the first evening we&#8217;ve had to ourselves
since the big snowdrift under the
front windows melted. That was about
the date Roger Barnes met Louis Lockwood
here the first time. Ye gods&mdash;but
they&#8217;ve kept each other&#8217;s footprints warm
since then, haven&#8217;t they? And now Cathcart
is giving indications of having contracted
the fatal malady. Can&#8217;t Rachel
Redding be incarcerated somewhere until
the next moon is past? I notice they all
have worse symptoms each third quarter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
That girl looks innocent, but&mdash;by heaven,
Julie, I think she has it down fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Juliet persuasively.
&#8220;I should catch her at it if she were deliberately
trying to keep two such men as Roger
and Louis pitted against each other. They&#8217;re
doing it all themselves. I&#8217;ve known her to
run away when she saw one of them coming&mdash;so
that she couldn&#8217;t be found. But,
Tony dear, I&#8217;ve a plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. I hope it&#8217;s a duel between the
two principals. If it is I&#8217;m going to tamper
with the weapons and see that each injures
himself past help. I&#8217;m getting a little
weary of playing the hospitable host to a
trio of would-bes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen. We&#8217;ll entertain them all at
once for a week, with some extra girls, and
Judith and Wayne, and then we&#8217;ll announce
that we&#8217;re not at home for a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All at once&mdash;a house-party?&#8221; Anthony
sat up and laughed uproariously. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
tremendous faith in you, love, but where
in the name of all the French sardines that
ever were dovetailed would you put such
a crowd?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a practical plan. Louis Lockwood
belongs to a fishing club that spends every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
August up in Canada. They have a big
tent, twenty by twenty-five, for he told me
so the other day. He would get it for us;
we would put it out in the orchard, close
to the river. You and Wayne, and Roger
and Louis, and Stevens Cathcart could
sleep down there, and I could easily take
care of Judith and Suzanne Gerard and
Marie Dresser, here in the house. Rachel
should stay here, too. And Auntie Dingley
would send down Mary McKaim to cook
for us, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not so bad. But why Rachel&mdash;when
you have so little room?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I want her to have all the fun;
because if I don&#8217;t keep her here she will
be running away half the time; and because&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now comes the real reason,&#8221; observed
Anthony sagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want the other girls thinking
she has the unfair advantage of taking a
man away from the party every evening to
walk down home with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wise little chaperon. I can see Roger
and Louis now, glaring at each other as the
hour approaches for her departure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of my plan? It&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
only a plan, you know, Tony&mdash;subject to
your approval.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Diplomat!&#8221; murmured Anthony, reaching
up one arm and drawing it about her
shoulders. &#8220;You know you&#8217;re safe to have
my approval when you put it in that tone.
Well, provided you can figure out the
finances&mdash;and I know you wouldn&#8217;t propose
it if you hadn&#8217;t done that already&mdash;I don&#8217;t
see any objection. On one condition,
though, Julie, mind you&mdash;on one condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Name it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I can only be here evenings
during your house party. So my condition
is that I have you and the home all to myself
for my vacation afterward. Not a
wooer nor a chum admitted. No overdressed
women out from town, taking afternoon
tea&mdash;no invitations to lonesome husbands
out to dinner. Just you and I. Did
you ever imagine life in the rural localities
would be so gay, anyhow? I want to go
fishing with you&mdash;tramping through the
woods with you&mdash;sitting out here on the
porch with you&mdash;in short, have you all
to myself&mdash;and&#8221;&mdash;he turned completely
about, kneeling below her on the step,
crushing her in both arms so vigorously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
that he stopped her breath&mdash;&#8220;eat&mdash;you&mdash;up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a prospect,&#8221; she cried softly,
when she found herself partially released.
&#8220;Are you sure you need a vacation, just
for that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain of it. I&#8217;ve had to share you
with other people all the year&mdash;and now
I&#8217;ve got to give you up to a jealous lovers&#8217;
assemblage. So after that, mind you, I
have my satisfaction.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When Doctor Barnes was told of the plan
he looked gloomy. &#8220;Going to ask Lockwood?&#8221;
he inquired at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; assented Juliet promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any &#8216;of course&#8217; about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would Marie Dresser do to me if
I didn&#8217;t invite him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t care for her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he does. Why, last winter he
seemed to be on the point of asking her to
marry him. Everybody expected the announcement
any day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last winter and this summer are two
different propositions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie doesn&#8217;t think so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll get mightily undeceived, then.
Whom else are you asking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stevens Cathcart.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor groaned. &#8220;Is this a dose
you&#8217;re fixing for me? I&#8217;m going to be too
busy&mdash;I can&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Juliet placidly. She
was sewing, upon the porch, and the doctor
sat on the step.</p>
<p>He looked up with a grimace. &#8220;I suppose
you think I&#8217;ll be out on the next train
after the rest arrive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do, Dr. Roger Williams
Barnes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume you are inviting Suzanne?&#8221;
he queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No reason why not. Cathcart admires
her immensely&mdash;or did, before he began to
cultivate this place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet laughed. &#8220;Suzanne would never
forgive you if she heard that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By-the-way,&#8221; said the doctor slowly,
&#8220;has she ever met&mdash;Miss Redding?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>He meditated for several minutes in
silence, while Juliet sewed, glancing from
time to time at one of the most attractive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
masculine profiles with which she was
familiar. He was not as handsome a man
as Louis Lockwood, but every line of his
face stood for strength, not without some
pretensions to good looks. He looked up
at length and straight at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you mind telling me,&#8221; he began,
&#8220;just what you intend to effect with this
combination? I never gave you credit,
you know, Juliet, for wanting to manage
Fate, and I don&#8217;t believe it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to manage Fate,&#8221; said
Juliet, smiling over her work, &#8220;but I admit
I want two things: I want you to see
Rachel Redding beside Suzanne Gerard,
and&mdash;I want Rachel to see you beside
Louis Lockwood and&mdash;Suzanne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said the doctor grimly. &#8220;In
other words, you want your protégée to
have fair play.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just that,&#8221; Juliet answered, more
gravely now. &#8220;I think lots of you, Roger,
and well of you&mdash;you know I do&mdash;and
yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me guard my girl. She&#8217;s not like
the others, and you and Louis are making
it tremendously hard for her between you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be planning to make it
infinitely harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet shook her head. &#8220;Trust me, Roger,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I will,&#8221; promised the doctor.
&#8220;But just assure me that you&#8217;re on my
side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on nobody&#8217;s side,&#8221; was all the
comfort he got.</p>
<p>Juliet&#8217;s invitations received delighted
acceptances, though Wayne Carey and
Doctor Barnes would be able to come out
only for the nights&mdash;in time, however, for
late and festive suppers outdoors. The
tent in the orchard, with its comfortable
bunks, was accepted by all the men with
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to satisfy the men is the essential
thing, you know, Tony,&#8221; Juliet had observed
sagely when she saw their pleasure in
their quarters. &#8220;The girls will accept any
crowding together if they have a mirror
and room to tie a sash in, as long as devoted
admirers are not wanting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment Miss Dresser and Miss
Gerard saw Miss Rachel Redding&mdash;to quote
Anthony&mdash;the fun began. Mrs. Wayne
Carey had already met her, and had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
carefully coached by Juliet as to the bearing
she must assume toward Juliet&#8217;s new friend.
So when Marie and Suzanne began to inquire
of Judith the latter was prepared to answer
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a beauty in her way, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;
Judith asserted. &#8220;Juliet&#8217;s immensely fond
of her, I should judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who is she?&#8221; demanded Suzanne.</p>
<p>&#8220;A neighbour, a country girl, a school
and college girl, a comparatively poor girl&mdash;and
a lucky girl, for Juliet likes her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have the men met her before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness, yes. Haven&#8217;t you heard how
they beg invitations home to dinner of
Anthony, just to see her?&#8221; Judith was
enjoying the situation. This statement,
however, was no part of Juliet&#8217;s coaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see anything particularly attractive
about her,&#8221; said Marie promptly.
&#8220;She&#8217;s a demure thing. One wouldn&#8217;t
think she ever lifted those long lashes to
look at a man&mdash;but that&#8217;s just the kind.
Awfully plainly dressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s her style,&#8221; said Suzanne. &#8220;These
poor, pretty girls are once in a while just
clever enough to make capital out of their
poverty by wearing simply fetching things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
in pale gray dimity and dark blue lawn and
sunbonnets. Stevens Cathcart would be
just the kind to be carried away with her.
Roger Barnes wouldn&#8217;t look at her twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Louis might pretend to admire her, to
please Juliet,&#8221; admitted Marie. &#8220;He has
a way of making every girl think he is in
love with her&mdash;and he is, to a certain extent.
But it&#8217;s never serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether it were serious in this instance
Miss Dresser soon had opportunity to judge.</p>
<p>After dinner that first night Anthony
proposed taking all his guests out upon the
river in a big flat-boat he had rented. But
when he made up the party Rachel was not
to be found.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid she&#8217;s gone home,&#8221; said Juliet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll run down and see,&#8221; proposed Lockwood
instantly, and was suiting the action
to the word when Cathcart got off ahead of
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have her back presently,&#8221; he called
as he dashed down the road. &#8220;You people
go on&mdash;we&#8217;ll catch you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait for you,&#8221; Lockwood shouted
after him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should we wait?&#8221; demurred Marie,
beginning to walk away toward the river.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t he&#8217;s liable not to find it convenient
to catch up with us,&#8221; Lockwood
retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they prefer their own company why
not let them have it?&#8221; she said over her
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Run along, Louis,&#8221; murmured Doctor
Barnes. &#8220;One girl at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to Juliet. &#8220;Shall we go?&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>Anthony caught his glance, and, laughing,
turned to Suzanne. &#8220;Will you console
an old married man, Miss Gerard?&#8221; he
inquired.</p>
<p>But when Cathcart reappeared, which
he did very soon, Rachel was not with him.
&#8220;She said she had to stay with her mother,&#8221;
he explained in a tone which so closely
resembled a growl that everybody laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bear up, Stevie, boy,&#8221; chaffed Wayne
Carey. &#8220;I&#8217;m confident she likes you, but
she may not like you all the time, you know.
They seldom do.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XVII.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Rachel Causes Anxiety</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In spite of all Juliet&#8217;s efforts to bring
about Rachel&#8217;s presence as one of her guests
she found herself unable to accomplish it.
Whenever she was needed for help Rachel
was never absent, but the moment she was
free the girl was off, and that quite without
the appearance of running away. The
men of the party followed her, but they were
not allowed to remain. The girls, confident
that her disappearances were part of a very
deep game, begged her to stay; it was useless.
Rachel&#8217;s excuses were ready, her
manner charmingly regretful in a quiet
way, but stay she would not.</p>
<p>Dr. Roger Barnes waylaid her one evening
as she was vanishing down the willow-bordered
path by the brook, leading to her
own home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you go again,&#8221; he began discontentedly.
&#8220;I wish I knew why.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rachel paused. It was difficult to do
otherwise with a large and determined
figure blocking a very narrow path.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have ever so many things waiting at
home for me to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At nine o&#8217;clock in the evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At whatever hour I am through at
Mrs. Robeson&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could imagine something of
what they are. It might relieve my mind
a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I will tell you,&#8221; said Rachel with
great appearance of frankness. &#8220;I have
to do some mending for mother, read the
evening paper for father, and set the bread.
Then the clothes must be sprinkled for
ironing in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor studied her face in the dimming
light. &#8220;Who washed the clothes?&#8221; he
asked bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you ought to ask?&#8221; said
Rachel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m in the habit of asking questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of patients&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of everybody I care for. You don&#8217;t
have to answer, but if you don&#8217;t I shall
know who did the washing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did it,&#8221; said Rachel steadily. &#8220;It
is easily done.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And then you came over here and got
breakfast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. I helped Mrs. Robeson and
Mary McKaim get it. Doctor Barnes, do
you know that you are standing directly
in my path?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;It&#8217;s what
I&#8217;m here for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shall have to go back and take
the road home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do you will evade me only to
encounter another man. Lockwood&#8217;s keeping
a ferret&#8217;s eye on the Robeson house
door; and I think Cathcart is already patrolling
the road in front of your house.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl turned. &#8220;You are making me
feel very absurd,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want to go
home, Doctor Barnes. Please let me pass
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I go with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s frank,&#8221; he said, amusement
and chagrin struggling for the uppermost.
&#8220;I wonder I don&#8217;t stalk angrily away&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roger Barnes threw back his head and
laughed. &#8220;I wish you would give some
other girls a leaf out of your book,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
&#8220;The more you turn me down the more
ardently I long to be with you; while the
opposite sort of thing&mdash;I&#8217;ll tell you, Miss
Redding, if you want to be rid of me try
these tactics: Say with a languishing smile,
&#8216;Oh, Doctor Barnes, won&#8217;t you take me a
little way down this lovely path?&#8217; Perhaps
that will accomplish your ends. I&#8217;ve often
felt an instant desire not to do the thing I&#8217;m
begged to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, Doctor Barnes,&#8217;&#8221; said Rachel Redding&mdash;and
he caught the mischief in her
tone&mdash;even Rachel could be mischievous, as
Juliet had said&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;won&#8217;t you take me a
little way down this lovely path?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With the greatest pleasure in the
world,&#8221; replied the doctor promptly, and
stood aside to let her pass him. Whereupon
she slipped by him, and before he
could realise that she had gone was running
fleetly away in the twilight down the winding,
willow-hung path. With an exclamation
he was off after her, but though he
dashed at the pace of a hunter through the
intricacies of the way he presently discovered
that he was following nothing but
the summer breeze rustling the willow
leaves and wafting into his face the breath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
of new-cut hay, the aftermath of late July.
He stopped at length and stared about him,
baffled and half angry.</p>
<p>&#8220;There never was a girl like you,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;If you are deliberately trying
to make men mad to get you you are succeeding
infuriatingly well. If I catch you
to-night it will be your fault if I tell you
what I think of you. I&#8217;ll tell you now, for
I suppose you are hiding somewhere in this
undergrowth till I give it up and you
can get away home. You shall listen to
me if you are here, for you can&#8217;t help
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was speaking in a low, even tone,
walking slowly along the path and peering
sharply into the bushes on both sides. Suddenly
he stood still. He had detected a
spot beside a low-hanging willow which
showed nearly white in the deepening
darkness. Rachel was wearing white
to-night, he remembered. His heart
quickened its paces and he paused an
instant to get past a certain tightening
in his throat.</p>
<p>Then he bent forward and whispered:
&#8220;If that&#8217;s not you there I can say what I
like, and there&#8217;ll be some satisfaction in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
that. If you&#8217;ll speak now you may save
yourself, but if you don&#8217;t I&#8217;ve no reason to
think it&#8217;s you, and so I can say&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sharply perceptible noise
farther down the path toward the Redding
home. Barnes turned quickly and stood
up straight, waiting. Footsteps came rapidly
along the path&mdash;no footsteps of hers, evidently.
A man&#8217;s voice humming a tune
grew momentarily plainer&mdash;then the voice
stopped humming and began to sing in a
subdued but clear and fine barytone:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>&#8220;Down through the lane</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Come I again</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Losing all fear,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Love and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The voice stopped. Two men&#8217;s figures
confronted each other in an extremely narrow
path. It was not too dark yet for each
to be plainly recognisable to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hallo&mdash;that you, Lockwood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi there, Roger Barnes; what you doing
here? Fishing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking for something I&#8217;ve lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting pretty dark to find it. Something
valuable?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Rather. Think I&#8217;ll give it up for to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad. Nice night.&#8221; Lockwood
was hastening toward the end of the path
which came out near Anthony&#8217;s house.
Barnes looked after him grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That voice of yours, young man,&#8221; he
thought, &#8220;handicaps me from the start.
Now, if I could just warble my emotions
that way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and peered again at the white
place by the tree. He moved stealthily
toward it, and ascertained presently that
it was not what it seemed. He rose to his
feet and walked rapidly down the path to
the Redding house. When he came in sight
of it he saw that the kitchen windows were
lighted and that a man stood with his arm
on the sill of one of them. Silhouetted
against the light were the familiar outlines
of Stevens Cathcart. As Barnes stood staring
amazedly at this, a slender figure in
white came to the window, and in the stillness
he could hear the quiet voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Please let me close the window, Mr.
Cathcart. Thank you&mdash;no&mdash;and good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Three Men in a Boat,&#8217; by Rachel Redding,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
murmured the doctor to himself,
and slipped back to the willow path, from
which he at length emerged to join the
group upon the porch&mdash;which then, it may
be observed, held for the first time that
night its full complement of men.</p>
<p>Three big Chinese lanterns shed a softly
pleasant light upon the porch and the lawn
at its foot. Suzanne Gerard and Marie
Dresser made a most attractive picture,
one in a low chair, the other upon a pile of
cushions on the step. Suzanne lightly
picked a mandolin. Marie was singing
softly:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Losing all fear,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0em;'>Love and my life will be true.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>It was one of the songs of the summer&mdash;foolish
words, seductive music&mdash;everybody
hummed it half the time. Roger Barnes
smiled to himself, remembering where he
had heard it last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here and give account,&#8221; commanded
Suzanne the instant he appeared.
&#8220;Every unmarried man vanished the moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
twilight fell. You are the last to
show your face. I challenge you, one and
all, to swear that you have not been within
sight of a certain small brown house at
the foot of the hill since supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice was music; in her eyes was
laughter. Marie sang on, pointing her
words with smiles at one and another of
the culprits.</p>
<p>From his seat on the threshold of the
door, where his head rested against Juliet&#8217;s
knee as she sat behind him, Anthony
laughed to himself. Then he turned his
head and whispered to his wife: &#8220;Feel
the claws through the velvet? Poor boys,
they have my sympathy.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;Rachel,&#8221; said Juliet decisively, next
morning, &#8220;to-night is the last of my house
party, and I refuse to let you off. I&#8217;m
asking ten or twelve more people out
from town. You must spend this evening
with my guests, or forfeit my friendship.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was smiling as she said it, but her
tone was not to be denied.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that is the alternative,&#8221; Rachel answered,
returning the smile with an affectionate
look of a sort which neither Louis
Lockwood nor Stevens Cathcart nor Dr.
Roger Barnes had ever seen on her face&mdash;though
they had dreamed of it&mdash;&#8220;of course
I shall stay. But I&#8217;ll tell you frankly I
would rather not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not, Rachel?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you know why not, Mrs. Robeson,&#8221;
Rachel answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know why not,&#8221; admitted Juliet.
&#8220;Girls are queer things, Ray. They defeat
their own ends all the time&mdash;lots of them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
Suzanne and Marie are dear girls, with ever
so many nice things about them, but they
don&#8217;t&mdash;they don&#8217;t know enough not to
pursue, chase, run down, the object of their
desires. And, of course, the object, being
run down panting, into a corner, dodges,
evades, gets out and runs away. Rachel,
dear, what are you going to wear to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My best frock,&#8221; said Rachel, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;White.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut out at the neck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Short in the sleeves?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the elbows. It was my sophomore
evening dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be all right, I know. Rachel,
wear a white rose in those low black braids
of yours&mdash;will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think I won&#8217;t,&#8221; refused Rachel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rachel did not answer. Into her cool
cheek crept a tinge of rebellious, telltale
colour.</p>
<p>Juliet studied her a minute in silence, then
came up to her and laying both hands on
her shoulders looked up into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You try to &#8216;play fair,&#8217; don&#8217;t you, dear?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
she said heartily, &#8220;whatever the rest may
do. And whatever they may do, Rachel
Redding, don&#8217;t you care. It&#8217;s not your
fault that they are as jealous of you as girls
can be and keep sweet outside. I&#8217;d be
jealous of you myself if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She paused,
laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you grow jealous,&#8221; said Rachel,
&#8220;it will be because you have grown blind.
If anybody ever wore his heart on his sleeve&mdash;no,
not there&mdash;but beating sturdily in the
right place for one woman in the world
it&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; said Anthony Robeson,
coming up behind them, &#8220;and I hope you
may convince her of it. She has no confidence
in her own powers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rachel stood looking at them a moment,
her dark eyes very bright. &#8220;To see you
two,&#8221; she said slowly at length, &#8220;is to
believe it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The evening promised to be a gay one.
The men of the party had sent to town for
many lanterns, flags and decorations of the
sort, and had made the porch and lawn the
setting for a brilliant scene. A dozen young
people had been asked out, and came
enthusiastically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wind up with a flourish,&#8221; said
Anthony in his wife&#8217;s ear as they descended
the stairs together, &#8220;and then we&#8217;ll send
them all off to-morrow where they&#8217;ll cease
from troubling. I think it was the best plan
in the world, but I&#8217;ll be glad to prowl about
my beloved home without observing Cathcart
scowling at Lockwood, Roger Barnes
evading Suzanne, or even my good boy
Wayne with that eternal wonder on his
face as to why his flat does not look like our
Eden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush&mdash;and don&#8217;t look too happy to-morrow,
Tony. Oh, here comes Rachel.
Isn&#8217;t she lovely?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, watch,&#8221; murmured Anthony, his
face full of amusement. &#8220;It&#8217;s as good as
the best comedy I ever saw. See Suzanne.
She never looked toward Rachel, but don&#8217;t
tell me she wasn&#8217;t aware of the very instant
Rachel came upon the porch. I
believe she read it in Roger Barnes&#8217;s face.
I&#8217;ll wager ten to one his pulse isn&#8217;t countable
at the present instant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame him,&#8221; Juliet answered,
smiling at her guests. &#8220;She&#8217;s my ideal of a
girl who won&#8217;t hold out a finger to the
men.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s your sort,&#8221; admitted Anthony.
&#8220;I know what it is&mdash;poor fellows&mdash;I&#8217;ve
been through it. Your cold shoulder
used to warm up my heart hotter than any
other girl&#8217;s kindness. Look at the boys
now. They can&#8217;t jump and run away from
the other girls, but they&#8217;d like to. And
they&#8217;re all deadly anxious for fear the
others will get the start. Say, Julie, you
ought not to have asked those new youngsters
down from town. They&#8217;ll catch it,
sure as fate; they&#8217;re at the susceptible
age. I see five of them now, all staring at
Rachel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You positively mustn&#8217;t stay here with
me any longer,&#8221; whispered Juliet. &#8220;Go
and devote yourself to her and keep them
off for a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life,&#8221; Anthony returned
&#8220;She can take care of herself. If I mix
up in this fray you&#8217;re likely to be husbandless.
Lockwood and Roger are getting
dangerous, and I&#8217;m going to keep on the
outskirts where it&#8217;s safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were all upon the lawn&mdash;Rachel,
unable to help herself, according to Anthony&#8217;s
intimation, the centre of a group
of men who would not give each other a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
chance&mdash;when a stranger appeared upon
the edge of the circle of light. He stood
watching the scene for a moment&mdash;a tall,
slender fellow, with a pale face and deep-set
eyes. Then he asked somebody to tell
Miss Redding that Mr. Huntington would
like to speak with her. Rachel, thus
summoned, rose, looked about her, caught
sight of the stranger, and went swiftly
down the lawn. A dozen people, among
them all the men who had been the guests
of the week, saw the meeting. They observed
that the newcomer put out both
hands, that his smile was very bright, and
that he stood looking down into Miss Redding&#8217;s
face as if at sight of it he had instantly
forgotten everything else in the world.</p>
<p>Rachel, leaving him, came back up the
lawn to find her hostess. As she passed
it became evident to a good many pairs
of sharp eyes that her beauty had received
a keen accession from the sweeping over
her cheeks of a burning blush&mdash;so unusual
that they could not fail to take note
of it.</p>
<p>Juliet came back down the lawn with
Rachel, who presented Mr. Huntington;
and presently, without a word of leave-taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
to any one else, the two went away
down the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, who under the heavens was that?&#8221;
grunted Louis Lockwood in Anthony&#8217;s ear,
catching his host around the corner of the
house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brother, perhaps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Relative?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a messenger, maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She blushed like anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she? Man she is going to marry,
probably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that can&#8217;t be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The lady looks marriageable to me,&#8221;
observed Anthony, strolling away.</p>
<p>He ran into Cathcart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, who was that fellow, Tony?&#8221; began
Stevens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He looked confoundedly as if he meant
to embrace her on the spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So he did,&#8221; agreed Anthony soothingly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame him, do you? He may not
have seen her for a month. What condition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
do you suppose you&#8217;d be in if a week
should get away from you out of her
vicinity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bother you, Tony&mdash;don&#8217;t you know who
he was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Intimate friend, I should judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She turned pink as a carnation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say hollyhock,&#8221; suggested Anthony,
&#8220;or peony. Only a vivid colour could do
justice to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; groaned Cathcart. &#8220;She
never looked like that for any of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; said Anthony promptly, and
got away, chuckling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, there, Robeson, man,&#8221; said
the voice of Dr. Roger Barnes, and Anthony
found himself again held up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, old Roger boy,&#8221; said his host
pleasantly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll amble down the road
a bit and give you a chance to get a grip on
yourself. No, I don&#8217;t know who he is.
I&#8217;m all worn out assuring Louis and Steve
of that. She did turn red, she did look upset&mdash;with
joy, I infer. That girl has made
more havoc in one short week&mdash;playing off
all the while, too&mdash;than Suzanne and Marie
have accomplished in the biggest season
they ever knew. And I believe, Roger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
boy, you&#8217;re about the hardest hit of any
of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor did not answer. The two
had walked away from the house and were
marching arm in arm at a good pace down
the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s as poor as a church mouse,&#8221; suggested
Anthony.</p>
<p>There was no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has a dead weight of a helpless
father and mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor put match to a cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet says her brother died of dissipation
in a gambling-house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Barnes began to chew hard on a
cigar that he had failed to light.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s a mighty sweet girl,&#8221; said
Anthony softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, Tony,&#8221; the doctor burst out.&mdash;&#8220;Oh,
hang it all&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said his friend, with a hand on
his shoulder. &#8220;Go ahead, Roger Barnes&mdash;there&#8217;s
nothing in life like it; and the good
Lord have mercy on you, for the sort of
girl worth caring for doesn&#8217;t know the
meaning of the word.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>&#8220;All gone, little girl,&#8221; said Anthony
jubilantly, as he turned back into the
house the next evening, after watching out
of sight the big touring-car of Lockwood&#8217;s
which had carried all his house-party away
at once. &#8220;They are mighty fine people and
I like them all immensely&mdash;but&mdash;I have
enjoyed to the full this speeding the parting
guest. And now for my vacation. It
begins to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; asked Juliet, allowing
him to draw her into his favourite settle
corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go fishing. If you&#8217;ll put up a jolly
little&mdash;I mean a jolly big&mdash;lunch, and array
yourself in unspoilable attire, I&#8217;ll give you
a day&#8217;s great sport, whether we catch any
fish or not. There&#8217;s one fish you&#8217;re sure
of&mdash;he&#8217;s always on the end of your line:
hooked fast, and resigned to his fate. Juliet,
are they really all gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good Mary McKaim&mdash;peace be to her
ashes, for she never gets any on the toast&mdash;has
she gone, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s packing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rachel safe at home with her presumable
fiancé?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t be her fiancé, Tony&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Lockwood said&mdash;but I suppose
he can, just the same. Rachel away,
do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. She didn&#8217;t come over to-day at
all, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed it&mdash;by the gloom on three
stalwart men&#8217;s faces. Well, if everybody&#8217;s
safely out of the way I&#8217;m going to commit
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To what, Tony?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was laughing, for he had risen, looked
all about him with great anxiety, tiptoed
to each door and listened at it, and was now
come back to stand before her, smiling
down at her and holding out his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the statement,&#8221; he said, gathering
her close and speaking into her upturned
rosy face, &#8220;that without doubt this is the
dearest home in the world, and that you
are the sweetest woman who ever has
stood or ever will stand here in it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>XIX.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>All the April Stars Are Out</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It was an April night&mdash;balmy with the
breath of an exceptionally early spring.
All the April stars were out as Anthony
came to the door of the little house, and
opening it flung himself out upon the
porch, drawing great breaths. He looked
up into the sky and clasped his arms
tightly over his breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;O God,&#8221; he said aloud, &#8220;take care
of her&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He went back into the house after a
minute, and paced the floor back and forth,
back and forth, stopping at each turn to
listen at the foot of the stairs; then took
up his stride again, his lips set, his eyes
dark with anxiety. Over and over he
went to the open door to look up at the
stars, as if somehow he could bear his ordeal
best outdoors.</p>
<p>When half the night had gone Mrs.
Dingley came downstairs. Anthony met
her at the foot. She smiled reassuringly
into his face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is hard for you, dear boy,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;But they think by morning&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morning!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is going well&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only two o&#8217;clock. Morning!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She says tell you she&#8217;s going to be very
happy soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>But at that Anthony turned away, where
his face could not be seen, and stood by the
open door. Mrs. Dingley laid an affectionate
hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, Tony,&#8221; she said gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is new to you. Juliet is young
and strong&mdash;and full of courage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the morning you&#8217;ll both be very
happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Anthony, dear,&#8221; said the kindly
little woman, &#8220;I never knew you to be so
faint of heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony faced around again. &#8220;If my
strength could do her any good I&#8217;d be a
lion for her,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But when all I
can do is to wait&mdash;and think what I&#8217;d do
if&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was gone suddenly into the night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
With a tender smile on her lips Mrs.
Dingley went on upon the errand which had
brought her downstairs. &#8220;It&#8217;s worth something
to a woman to be able to make a
man&#8217;s heart ache like that,&#8221; she said to
herself with a little sigh. Anthony would
not have understood, but even in this
hour the older woman, in her wisdom, was
envying Juliet.</p>
<p>Morning came at last, as mornings do.
With the first streaks of the gray dawn
Anthony heard a little, high-keyed, strange
cry&mdash;new to his ears. He leaped up the
stairs, four at a time, and paused, breathless,
by the closed door of the blue-and-white
room. After what seemed to him an interminable
time Mrs. Dingley came out.
At sight of Anthony her face broke into
smiles, and at the same moment tears
filled her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a splendid boy, Tony,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
meant to come to you the first minute, but
I waited to be perfectly sure. He didn&#8217;t
breathe well at first.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Anthony pushed this news aside
impatiently. &#8220;Juliet?&#8221; he questioned
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all right, you poor man,&#8221; Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
Dingley assured him. &#8220;You shall see her
presently, just for a minute. The first
thing she said was, &#8216;Tell Tony.&#8217; Go down
now&mdash;I&#8217;ll call you soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony stole away downstairs to the
outer door again. This time he ran out
upon the porch and down the lawn and
orchard, in the early half-light, to the willow
path by the brook. He dashed along this
path to its end and back again, as if he
must in some way give expression to his
relief from the tension of the night. But
he was back and waiting impatiently long
before he received his summons to his wife&#8217;s
room.</p>
<p>On his way up he wrung the friendly
hand of Dr. Joseph Wilberforce, the best
man in the city at times like these, and
thanked him in a few uneven words. Then
he came to the door of the blue-and-white
room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, Tony,&#8221; said a very
sweet, clear voice; &#8220;we&#8217;re ever so well&mdash;Anthony
Robeson, Junior, and I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony Robeson, Senior, walked across
the room in a dim, gray fog which obscured
nearly everything except the sight of a pair
of eyes which were shining upon him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
brightly enough to penetrate any fog. At
the bedside he dropped upon his knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;m an awful chump,&#8221; he
murmured, &#8220;but nothing ever broke me
up so in all my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet laughed. It was not a sentimental
greeting, but she understood all it meant.
&#8220;But I&#8217;m so happy, dear,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you? Somehow I can&#8217;t seem to
be&mdash;yet. I&#8217;m too badly scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s such a beautiful big boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I shall be devoted to him some
time, but all I can think of now is to make
sure I&#8217;ve got you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pleasant-faced nurse in her white
cap came softly in and glanced at Tony
meaningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll come in here you may see your
son, Mr. Robeson,&#8221; she said, and went out
again.</p>
<p>Anthony bent over his wife. &#8220;<i>Little
mother</i>,&#8221; he whispered, with a kiss, and
obediently went.</p>
<p>Across the hall he stood looking dazedly
down at the round, warm bundle the nurse
laid in his arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;My son,&#8221; he said; &#8220;how odd that
sounds.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>Then he hastily gave the bundle back to
the nurse and got away downstairs, wiping
the perspiration from his brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never dreamed it was going to knock
me over like this,&#8221; he was saying to himself.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t look at her; I can&#8217;t look at him; I
feel like a big boy who has seen a little
fellow take his thrashing for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in this humble&mdash;albeit most sincerely
thankful&mdash;frame of mind he absently drank
his breakfast coffee, and never realised that
in her confusion of spirit good Mary McKaim,
who was here again in time of need,
had brewed him instead a powerful cup of
tea.</p>

</div>

<p>&#8220;Come up, come up&mdash;you&#8217;re just the
people we want,&#8221; cried Anthony heartily
from his own porch. &#8220;Thought you&#8217;d be
getting out to see us some of these fine
August nights. Sit down&mdash;Juliet will be
out in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Baby asleep?&#8221; asked Judith Carey, as
she and Wayne settled comfortably into
two of the deep bamboo chairs with which
the porch was furnished.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure he&#8217;s asleep at this hour,&#8221;
Anthony assured her proudly; &#8220;been asleep
for two hours. Regular as a clock, that
youngster. Nurse trained him right at the
beginning, and Juliet has kept it up. Four
months old now, and sleeps from six at night
till four in the morning without waking.
How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s remarkable,&#8221; agreed
Wayne meekly, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t know anything
about it. He might sleep twenty-three
hours out of twenty-four&mdash;I shouldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
understand whether to call him a prodigy
or an idiot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, you would,&#8221; Judith interposed
with spirit. &#8220;Think of that baby on
the floor above us. They&#8217;re walking the
floor half the night with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Girl babies may be different,&#8221; Carey
suggested diffidently, at which Anthony
shouted. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care&mdash;all the girls I
ever knew wanted to sit up nights,&#8221; Carey
insisted with a feeble grin.</p>
<p>Juliet came out, welcoming her friends
with the cordiality for which she was
famous. &#8220;It&#8217;s so hot in town,&#8221; she condoled
with them. &#8220;You should get out
into our delicious air oftener. Somehow,
with our breezes we don&#8217;t mind the heat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s heaven here, anyhow,&#8221; sighed
Carey, stretching back in his chair with a
long breath. Judith looked sober.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say it&#8217;s heaven,&#8221; commented
Anthony, staring hard at his friend, &#8220;and
you profess to admire everything we do, and
eat, and say, but you continue to pay good
money every week for a lot of extremely
dubious comforts&mdash;from my point of view.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the very best places in that
part of the city,&#8221; protested Judith.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>Anthony eyed her keenly. &#8220;Yes; if
that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re paying for you&#8217;ve got
it, I admit. If it&#8217;s a consolation to you to
know that the address you give when you
go shopping is one that you&#8217;re not ashamed
of&mdash;why, you&#8217;re all right. But I reckon
Juliet here doesn&#8217;t blush when she orders
things sent home to the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Juliet&mdash;&#8221; began Judith; &#8220;she doesn&#8217;t
need an address to make all the salespeople
pay her their most respectful attention.
She&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Anthony. &#8220;That
sweetly imperious way of hers when she
shops&mdash;I remember it the first time I ever
went shopping with her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet gave him a laughing glance. &#8220;If
I remember,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it wasn&#8217;t I who
did all the dictating on that historic expedition
when we furnished this house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to go shopping again,&#8221;
Anthony informed them. &#8220;We&#8217;re planning
to put a little wing on the house, opening
from under the stairs in the living-room,
for a nursery and a den.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to put the two together?&#8221; asked
a new voice from the dimness of the lawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;hullo, Roger Barnes, M.D.,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
F.R.C.S.&mdash;come up. No, I think we&#8217;ll
have a partition between. But I want a
room below stairs for Tony, Junior, so
his mother won&#8217;t wear herself out carrying
him up and down. That youngster
weighs seventeen pounds and a fraction
already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was confident I&#8217;d get some statistics
if I came out,&#8221; said the doctor, settling
himself near Juliet&mdash;with a purpose, as she
instantly recognised. &#8220;It seemed to me
I couldn&#8217;t wait longer to learn how much
he had gained since I met Tony day before
yesterday. It was seventeen without the
fraction then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&mdash;guy me,&#8221; returned Anthony
comfortably. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind&mdash;I&#8217;ve
the boy.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;I want a talk with you,&#8221; said the doctor
softly to Juliet, as the others fell to discussing
the project of the enlarged house.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to have it, too&mdash;or go off my
head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet nodded, understanding him. Presently
she rose. &#8220;I have an errand to do,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Will you walk over to the
Evanstons&#8217; with me, Roger?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now, tell me,&#8221; began the doctor the
instant they were off, &#8220;is she going to
persist in this awful sacrifice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Rachel,&#8221; breathed Juliet. &#8220;So
many lovers&mdash;and so unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she unhappy?&#8221; begged the doctor.
&#8220;Is she? If I only were sure of it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What girl wouldn&#8217;t be unhappy&mdash;to be
making even one man out of two as miserable
as you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you know what I mean. Is she
going to marry Huntington out of love as
well as pity&mdash;or only pity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger&#8221;&mdash;Juliet stood still in the road,
regarding him in the dim light with kind
eyes&mdash;&#8220;if I knew I wouldn&#8217;t tell you. That&#8217;s
Rachel&#8217;s secret. But I don&#8217;t know. She&#8217;s
as loyal as a magnet, and as reserved as&mdash;you
would want her to be if you were Mr.
Huntington.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s everything she ought to be. I&#8217;m
a dastard for saying it, but I could forgive
her for being disloyal enough to him to
show me just a corner of her heart. Even
if she loves him it&#8217;s what I called it&mdash;an
awful sacrifice&mdash;a man dying with consumption.
If she doesn&#8217;t&mdash;except as the
friend of her early girlhood, when she didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
know men or her own heart&mdash;Juliet, it&#8217;s
impious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roger, dear, keep hold of yourself,&#8221;
Juliet replied. &#8220;You&#8217;re too strong and
fine to want to come between her
and her own decision&mdash;if she has
made it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were a man,&#8221; said he hotly,
&#8220;would you let a woman marry you&mdash;dying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Juliet stoutly, &#8220;if she
insisted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Women are capable of saying anything
in an argument,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;I
say it&#8217;s outrageous to let her do it. She
doesn&#8217;t love him&mdash;she does love me,&#8221; he
blurted.</p>
<p>Juliet turned to him anxiously. &#8220;Roger,
do you know what you are saying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. I&#8217;ve got to tell somebody,
and there&#8217;s nobody but you&mdash;you perfect
woman. If ever a man knew a thing
without its being put into words I know
that. It was only a look, weeks ago, but
I&#8217;m as sure of it as I am of myself. I&#8217;ve
had nothing but coolness from her since,
but that&#8217;s in self-defense. And the thought
that, loving me, she&#8217;s going to give herself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
to him&mdash;a wreck&mdash;do you wonder it&#8217;s
driving me mad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought not to have told me this,&#8221;
said Juliet, tears in her voice. &#8220;If Rachel
is doing this it&#8217;s because she&#8217;s sure she
ought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course she is. And that&#8217;s why I tell
you. You have more influence with her
than any one. Can&#8217;t you show her that
duty, the most urgent in the world, never
requires a thing like that? Let her be his
friend to the last&mdash;the sort of friend she
knows how to be, with a warm hand in his
cold one. But never his&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor grew choky with his vehemence,
and stopped short. Juliet was
silent, full of distress. She thought of the
two men&mdash;Huntington, a frail ghost, in the
grip of a deadly illness, yet fighting it desperately,
and desperately clinging to the
girl he loved: a clever fellow, educated as a
mining engineer, successful, even beginning
to be distinguished in his work until his
health gave out; Barnes, the embodiment
of strength, standing high in his profession,
life and the world before him, a fit mate for
the girl who deserved the best there could
be for her&mdash;Juliet thought of them both and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
found her heart aching for them&mdash;and for
Rachel Redding.</p>
<p>They were slowly approaching the brown
house at the foot of the hill, the errand at
the Evanstons&#8217; forgotten, when suddenly a
familiar figure in white came toward them
from the doorway. The doctor started at
sight of it, and Juliet grew breathless all at
once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was you two,&#8221; said Rachel.
&#8220;This rising moon struck you full just now,
and I could see you plainly. I&#8217;ve wanted
to see you both&mdash;and this is my last chance.
I am going away to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an instant&#8217;s silence, while
Roger Barnes tried to choose which of all
the things he wanted to say to her should
come first. Juliet broke the stillness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Walk back up the road with us, dear,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;and tell us how and where you
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have but a minute to spare,&#8221; said
Rachel. &#8220;Let me say good-bye to you
both here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, by heaven, you shall not,&#8221; burst
out the doctor in a suppressed voice of
fire which startled Juliet. &#8220;You owe me
ten minutes, in place of the last letter you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
haven&#8217;t answered. There are a score of
them, you know&mdash;but the last has to be
answered somehow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rachel hesitated. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said
at length, &#8220;but only with Mrs. Robeson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you trust me?&#8221; He was angry
now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;but not myself,&#8221; she answered,
so low he barely caught the words. He
seized her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then trust me for us both,&#8221; he said, so
instantly gentle and tender that Juliet
found it possible to say what a moment
before she had thought unwise enough:
&#8220;Go with him, Ray, dear. I think it is his
right.&#8221;</p>
<p>So presently she found herself crossing her
own lawn alone, while the two who had just
left her went slowly on up the road together.
Her heart was beating hard and painfully,
for she loved them both, and foresaw for
them only the hardest interview of their
lives.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>At the end of half an hour Rachel Redding
stood again upon her own porch, and
Roger Barnes looked up at her from the
walk below with heavy eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have done what
I never would have believed even you could
do&mdash;convinced me against my will that you
are right. You love him&mdash;he worships you.
There is a promise of life for him in Arizona&mdash;with
you. I can&#8217;t forbid the bans. But
I shall always believe, what you dare not
dispute, that if I had come first&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She held out her hand. &#8220;That you must
not say,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But there is one thing
you may say&mdash;that you are my best friend,
whom I can count on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as there is life left in me,&#8221; he
answered fervently. He wrung her hand
in both his, looked long and steadily up into
her face as if his eyes could never leave
the lovely outlines showing clear in the
light from the windows, then turned away
and strode off toward the station without
a look behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should do it in brown leather,&#8221; said
Cathcart decidedly, looking about him.</p>
<p>He stood in the centre of Anthony&#8217;s den.
The carpenters had gone, the plasterers
had finished their work, and the floor had
just been swept up.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right as far as you go,&#8221; observed
Anthony, who stood at his elbow,
&#8220;but you don&#8217;t go far enough. If you
want me to hang these walls with brown
leather you&#8217;ll have to put up the money.
I may be sufficiently prosperous to afford
the addition to my house, but I haven&#8217;t
reached the stage of covering the walls with
cloth-of-gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Burlap would be the thing, Tony,&#8221;
Judith suggested.</p>
<p>Anthony was surrounded by people&mdash;the
room was half full of them, elbowing
each other about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paint the walls,&#8221; advised Lockwood.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are imitation-leather papers,&#8221;
said Cathcart, with the air of one condescending
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
to lower a high standard for the
sake of those who could not live up to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; admitted Anthony, &#8220;at
four dollars a roll. I saw a simple thing
on that order that struck me the other day
at Heminways&#8217;. I thought it might be
about forty cents a roll. It was a dollar a
square yard. I told them I would think
it over. I haven&#8217;t got through thinking it
over yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want a plate-rail,&#8221; said Wayne
Carey.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, to put plates, and steins, and
things on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t a plate&mdash;or a stein. Baby has
a silver mug. Would that do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cathcart smiled in a superior way.
&#8220;You had a lot of mighty fine stuff in your
Yale days,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Pity you let
it all go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have cared for that truck
now,&#8221; Anthony declared easily, though he
deceived nobody by it. Most of them remembered,
if Cathcart had forgotten, how
the college boy had sacrificed all his treasures
at a blow when the news of his family&#8217;s
misfortunes had come. It had yielded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
little enough, after all, to throw into the
abyss of their sudden poverty, but the act
had proved the spirit of the elder son of the
house.</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly will want plenty of rugs
and hangings of the right sort,&#8221; Cathcart
pursued.</p>
<p>Anthony looked at him good-humouredly.
&#8220;I can see that you have got to be suppressed,&#8221;
he said, with a hand on Stevens&#8217;s
collar. &#8220;I can tell you in a breath just
what&#8217;s going into this room at present.
The floor is to have a matting, one of those
heavy, cloth-like mattings. Auntie Dingley
has presented me with one fine old Persian
rug from the Marcy library, which she insists
is out of key with the rest of the stuff.
I&#8217;m glad it is&mdash;it&#8217;ll furnish the key to my
decorations. Then I&#8217;ve a splendid old desk
I picked up in a place where they temporarily
forgot themselves in setting a price on it.
That&#8217;s going by the window. I&#8217;ve a little
Dürer engraving, and a few good foreign
photographs Juliet has put under glass for
me. For the rest I have&mdash;what I like best&mdash;clear
space, pipe-and-hearth room, the
bamboo chairs off the porch with some
winter cushions in, my books&mdash;and that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>He pointed to the windows, outside
which lay a long country vista stretching
away over fields and river to the
woods in the distance, turning rich autumn
tints now under the late October
frosts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s enough,&#8221; said Carey, with the suppressed
sigh which usually accompanied any
allusion of his to Anthony&#8217;s environment.
&#8220;Dens are too stuffy, as a rule. Fellows
try to see how much useless lumber they
can accumulate in altogether inadequate
space.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you ought to have a couch,&#8221; said
Judith.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m going to have a couch,&#8221;
assented Anthony, laughing across her head
at Juliet. &#8220;A gem of a couch&mdash;we&#8217;re
making it ourselves. You&#8217;re not to see it
till it&#8217;s done. It&#8217;ll be no brickbat couch,
either&mdash;it&#8217;ll be a flowery bed of ease&mdash;or,
if not flowery, invitingly covered with some
stunning stuff Juliet has fished out of a
neighbour&#8217;s attic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, come and see the nursery,&#8221; Juliet
proposed, and the party crowded through
the door into the living-room, around to
the one by its side which opened into an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
attractive room behind the den, all air
and sunshine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse to suggest,&#8221; said Cathcart instantly,
&#8220;the decorations for this place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; remarked Anthony cheerfully.
&#8220;So much verbiage out of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be pink and white, I suppose,&#8221; said
Judith. &#8220;Pink is the colour for boys, I&#8217;m
told.&#8221;</p>
<p>Behind all their backs Anthony glanced
at his wife, affection and amusement in
his face. She read the look and smiled
back. It was no part of their plan to let
the boy grow up alone. And as a mother
she seemed to him far more beautiful than
she had ever been.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to have a little paper with
nursery-rhyme pictures all over it,&#8221; explained
Juliet. &#8220;There are all sorts of
softly harmonising colours in it. And just
a matting on the floor with a rug to play on,
his white crib, and some gay little curtains
at the windows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you made the partition double-thick,
old man?&#8221; asked Lockwood. &#8220;This
den-nursery combination strikes me as a
little dubious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use explaining to a fiendish old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
bachelor,&#8221; said Anthony, leading the way
out of the place, &#8220;that I&#8217;d think I was
missing a good deal if I should get so far
away that I couldn&#8217;t hear little Tony laugh&mdash;or
cry. Julie, where&#8217;s the boy? May I
bring him down?&#8221;</p>
<p>He disappeared upstairs, whence sounds
of hilarity were at once heard. Presently
he reappeared on the stairs, bearing aloft
upon his shoulder a rosy cherub of a baby,
smiling and waving a chubby fist at the
company. The beauty in his face was
an exquisite mixture of that belonging
to both father and mother. Anthony and
his son together made a picture worth
seeing.</p>
<p>Once more Wayne Carey smothered a
sigh. But Judith hardened her heart.
Since Baby Anthony had come Wayne had
been difficult to manage.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Lockwood stayed after the others had
gone. Sitting smoking before the fire with
Anthony after Juliet had left them alone
he brought the conversation around to a
point which Anthony had expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you hear of that man Huntington?&#8221;
he asked, as indifferently as a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
is ever able to ask a question which means
much to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huntington? Why, the last was that
he was improving a little, I believe. Arizona
is a great place for that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good deal of a sacrifice for her people
to go with her way out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She couldn&#8217;t leave them behind. Father
half-blind&mdash;mother a cripple. I understand
that Arizona air is bracing them, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow&#8217;s own mother was one of the
party, wasn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe so. He&#8217;s all she has.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see, with all those people to
chaperon her, why she couldn&#8217;t have gone
along with him without marrying him,&#8221;
observed Lockwood in a gruff tone.</p>
<p>Anthony smiled. &#8220;That would have
been a Tantalus draught indeed,&#8221; he
remarked. &#8220;I imagine poor Huntington
will need all the concessions he can get if
he keeps on breathing even Arizona air.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthony,&#8221; said Lockwood, after a
silence of some minutes, during which he
had puffed away with his eyes intent on the
fire, &#8220;do you fancy Rachel Redding cared
enough for that man to immolate herself
like that?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Looks very much like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it looks like it; but if I read that
girl right she was the sort to stick to anything
she&#8217;d said she&#8217;d do, if it took the
breath out of her body. How long had she
known him&mdash;any idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A good while, I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so. Early engagement, you
see&mdash;ought never to have stood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d been Huntington you&#8217;d probably
have had the unreasonable notion that
it should.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a magnificent girl,&#8221; said Lockwood,
blowing a great volume of smoke
into the air with head elevated and half-shut
eyes. &#8220;She made those two who were
here with her last summer seem like thirty
cents beside her. Nice girls, too&mdash;fine
girls&mdash;elegant dressers; I don&#8217;t know what
the matter was. Neither did they.&#8221; He
chuckled a little. &#8220;They couldn&#8217;t believe
their own eyes when they saw three of us
going daft over a girl they wouldn&#8217;t have
staked a copper on in a free-for-all with
themselves. They took it gamely, I&#8217;ll say
that for them. Marie won&#8217;t have me back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither do I. Haven&#8217;t got to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
want-to-be-taken-back stage&mdash;sometimes
think I never shall. One experience like
that spoils a man for the average girl.
The truth is, Tony, the most of them&mdash;er&mdash;overdo
the meet-you-half-way act. I want
a girl to keep me guessing till the last
minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell that to the girl,&#8221; advised Anthony.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could. Yet there were a good
many times when I thought if Rachel
Redding would just look my way I shouldn&#8217;t
take it ill of her. I wonder if she&#8217;d have
been like that if she hadn&#8217;t been engaged to
another fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably.&#8221; Anthony got up and
stretched himself. He was growing weary
of other men&#8217;s confidences.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right she would. She&#8217;s built
that way. Yet when you get to fancying
what she&#8217;d be if she just let herself go and
show she cared&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, my young friend,&#8221; said Anthony,
&#8220;I advise you to go home and go to
bed. Sitting here dreaming over Mrs. Alexander
Huntington isn&#8217;t good for you. What
you want to be doing is to forget her.
Huntington&#8217;s going to get well, and they&#8217;re
going to live happily ever after, and you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
fellows out here can look up other girls.
Plenty of &#8217;em. Only, for the love of heaven,
see if you can avoid all setting your affections
on the same girl next time. It&#8217;s
too rough on your friends!&#8221;</p>

<p>Time went swinging on, and by and by it
came to be Tony Robeson, Junior&#8217;s, second
Christmas day. He rode down to breakfast
on his father&#8217;s shoulder, crowing loudly on
a gorgeous brown and scarlet rooster, which
he had found on his Christmas tree the
evening before. He had been put to bed
immediately thereafter and had gone to
sleep with the rooster in his arms. The
fowl had a charmingly realistic crow, operated
by a pneumatic device upon which
the baby had promptly learned to blow.
He performed upon it uninterruptedly
throughout breakfast.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, my son,&#8221; said Anthony, hurriedly
finishing his coffee, &#8220;let&#8217;s see if you
can&#8217;t appreciate some of your less voiceful
toys. Here&#8217;s a rabbit with fine soft ears
for you to pull. There&#8217;s a train of cars.
Let me wind it for you. Your Grandfather
Marcy must have expended several good
dollars on that&mdash;you want to show up an
interest in it when he comes out to see you
to-day. And here&#8217;s Auntie Dingley&#8217;s pickaninny
boy-doll&mdash;well, I don&#8217;t blame you
for failing to embrace that. Auntie Dingley
was born in Massachusetts.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;Toys which can be relied upon to please a twenty months old infant.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The boy cast an indifferently polite eye
on these gifts as their charms were exhibited
to him, and clasped the brown and scarlet
rooster to his breast. There were moments,
half hours even, when he became sufficiently
diverted from his fowl to cease from making
it crow, but at intervals throughout the
day the family were given to understand
once for all that it is not the most expensive
and ornate toys which can be relied upon
to please a twenty-months-old infant. Even
the automobile presented by Dr. Roger
Barnes, and warranted to go three times
around the room without stopping, was a
tame affair to the recipient compared with
the rooster&#8217;s shrill salute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, Tony,&#8221; Juliet had said, a
month before Christmas, &#8220;you are not to
give me any expensive personal gift this
year. I care for nothing half so much as for
making the home complete. If&mdash;if&mdash;you
cared to give me something toward the
bathroom fund&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Anthony promptly, for he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
had learned by this time to know his wife well.
The bathroom fund was dear to her heart.
The small room at the front of the house
upstairs, which had been left unfurnished,
had been temporarily fitted up as a bathroom
by sundry ingenious devices in the
way of a tin bath and a hot and cold water
connection, but a full equipment of the best
sort was to be put in as soon as practicable,
and there was a growing fund therefor.</p>
<p>On Christmas morning, nevertheless, in
addition to a generous addition to the fund,
Juliet found beside her plate an exceedingly
&#8220;personal gift&#8221; in the shape of a little
pearl-and-turquoise brooch of rare design,
bearing the stamp of a superior maker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must I scold you?&#8221; she asked, smiling
up at him as he stood beside her, watching
her face flush with pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiss me, instead,&#8221; he answered
promptly. &#8220;And don&#8217;t expect me to give
up making you now and then a real present,
even though it has to be a small one. It&#8217;s
too much fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beside his own plate he found her gift,
a set of histories he had long wanted. It
was a beautiful edition, and he would have
looked reproachfully at the giver if she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
had not forestalled him by running around
the table to say softly in his ear, both arms
about his neck: &#8220;Just at Christmas time,
dearest, let me have my way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The day was a happy one. Mr. Horatio
Marcy and Mrs. Dingley arrived on the
morning train and stayed until evening.
At the Christmas dinner Judith and Wayne
Carey and Dr. Roger Barnes were the additional
guests, and Mary McKaim was in the
kitchen. Dinner over, everybody sat about
the fireplace talking, when Juliet came in
to carry little Tony off to bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Five minutes more,&#8221; begged Dr. Barnes,
on whose knee the child sat, a willing captive
to the arts of his entertainer. His
eyes, bright with the excitement of this
great day, were fixed upon the doctor&#8217;s
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;And so&#8221;&mdash;Barnes continued the story
he had begun&mdash;&#8220;the rooster climbed right
up the man&#8217;s leg&#8221;&mdash;the toy obeyed his
command and scaled the eminence from
the floor where it had been hiding behind
a Noah&#8217;s ark&mdash;&#8220;and perched on his knee,
and cried&#8221;&mdash;the rooster crowed lustily
and little Tony laughed ecstatically. &#8220;Then
the rooster flew up on the man&#8217;s shoulder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
and flapped his wings, and all at once he
fell right over backwards and tumbled on his
head on the floor.&mdash;Got to go to bed,
Tony? Shall the rooster go too? All right.
May I carry him up for you, Juliet? Anthony&#8217;s
deep in that discussion. Get on my
back, old man&mdash;that&#8217;s the way!&#8221;</p>
<p>Everybody looked after the two as the
doctor mounted the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;That rooster has captivated the child
more than all the mechanical toys he has
had to-day,&#8221; said Mrs. Dingley.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a handsome fellow he is,&#8221; said
Carey, his eyes following little Tony till he
disappeared. &#8220;I never saw a healthier,
happier child. How sturdy he is on his
legs&mdash;have you noticed? He&#8217;s saying a
good many words, too. It was as good as
a play to see him imitate that rooster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet&#8217;s father and Mrs. Dingley left on an
early evening train, and only the three
younger guests remained when Juliet came
downstairs after putting her boy to bed.
She set about gathering up the toys scattered
over the floor, and Barnes helped her.
In the midst of this labour, during which
they all made merry with some of the more
elaborate mechanical affairs, Juliet suddenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
said &#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; and went to the
bottom of the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; offered Anthony. &#8220;He&#8217;s
probably too excited to get to sleep easily
after all this dissipation.&mdash;Hullo!&mdash;he&#8217;s
crowing with the rooster yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Juliet went up, and he followed her,
saying from the landing to his guests,
&#8220;Excuse me for a little. I&#8217;ll get the boy
quiet, and let his mother come down. I&#8217;ve
a fine talent for that sort of thing. That
rooster will have to be given some soothing
syrup&mdash;he&#8217;s too lively a fowl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw a man fonder of his youngster
than Tony,&#8221; Carey observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The child is a particularly fine specimen,&#8221;
the doctor said. &#8220;I think I never
saw a more ideal development than he
shows.&#8221;</p>
<p>He began to tell an incident in which
little Tony had been involved, when he
was interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barnes!&#8221;&mdash;called Anthony&#8217;s voice from
the top of the stairs. &#8220;Come up here,
please.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something in the imperative
quality of this summons which made the
doctor run up the stairs, two at a time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Judith and Wayne listened. The rooster
could still be heard crowing, faintly but
distinctly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;s grown too excited over it,&#8221;
Judith suggested. &#8220;They ought to take
it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carey went to the bottom of the stairs and
listened. There were rapid movements overhead.
The doctor&#8217;s voice could be heard
giving directions through which sounded
the steady crowing of the toy. &#8220;Hold him
so&mdash;now move him that way as I thump&mdash;now
the other&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Carey turned pale. &#8220;He&#8217;s got that rooster
in his throat,&#8221; he said solemnly. The
rooster was nearly life-size, but the incongruity
of this suggestion did not strike
him. Judith hastily rose from her chair
and went to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had we better go up?&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens&mdash;no!&#8221; Judith clutched his
arm. &#8220;We couldn&#8217;t do any good. The
doctor&#8217;s there. Such things make me ill.
They ought not to have let him have the
toy to take to bed with him. How could it
get into his throat? Perhaps they are
making it crow to divert him. Perhaps
he&#8217;s hurt himself somehow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got the crow part of that thing in
his throat,&#8221; Carey persisted in an anxious
whisper. &#8220;The manufacturers ought to
be prosecuted for making a toy that will
come apart like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stand there,&#8221; protested his wife.
&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s nothing. Come here and sit
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Carey stood still. Presently Anthony
came to the head of the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wayne,&#8221; said he rapidly, &#8220;telephone
Roger&#8217;s office. Ask the trained nurse,
Miss Hughes, to send a messenger with the
doctor&#8217;s emergency surgical case by the
first train&mdash;he can catch the 9:40 if he&#8217;s
quick. Tell Miss Hughes to follow as soon
as she can get ready, prepared to stay all
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he disappeared. His voice had
been steady and quiet, but his eyes had
showed his friend that the order was given
under tension. Carey sprang to the telephone,
and his hand shook as he took down
the receiver.</p>
<p>Upstairs Roger Barnes, in command, was
giving cool, concise orders, his eyes on his
little patient. When he had despatched
Juliet for various things, including boiling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
water which she must get downstairs, he
said to Anthony in a conversational tone:</p>
<p>&#8220;It will probably not be safe to wait till
my instruments get here, and there&#8217;s no
surgeon near enough to call. I&#8217;m not
going to take any chances on this boy.
If I see the necessity I&#8217;m going to get into
that throat and give him air. I shall want
you and Carey to hold him. Juliet must be
downstairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony nodded. He did not quite
understand; but a few minutes later, when
Juliet had brought the boiling water,
he suddenly perceived what his friend
meant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alcohol, now, please,&#8221; said the doctor.
When Juliet had disappeared again Barnes
drew from his pocket a pearl-handled
pocket-knife and tried its blades. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
fortunate thing somebody made me a
present of such a good one to-day,&#8221; he observed,
&#8220;but it needs sharpening a bit.
Have you an oil-stone handy?&#8221;</p>
<p>With tightly shut lips Anthony watched
the doctor put a bright edge on his smallest
blade, then, satisfied, drop the open knife
into the water bubbling over a spirit-lamp.
Anthony turned his head away for an instant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
from the struggling little figure on
the bed. Barnes eyed him keenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re game, of course?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Anthony&#8217;s eyes met his and flashed fire.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know me better than that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; and the young surgeon
smiled. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve seen a medical man
himself go to pieces over his own child.
This is a simple matter,&#8221; he went on lightly.
&#8220;Luckily, boiling water is a more potent
antiseptic than all the drugs on the market&mdash;and
alcohol&#8217;s another. I shall want a
new hairpin or two&mdash;if Juliet has a wire
one.&mdash;That the alcohol? Thank you. Now
if you&#8217;ve the hairpins, Juliet&mdash;ah&mdash;a silver
one&mdash;all the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>This also he dropped into the boiling
water. Then he spoke very quietly to
Tony&#8217;s mother, as she bent over her child,
fighting for his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit tough to watch,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but we&#8217;ll have him all right presently.
Suppose you go and get his crib ready for
him. You might fill some hot-water bags
and bottles and have things warm and
comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The telephone-bell rang below. After a
minute Carey dashed upstairs. He looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
into the room and spoke anxiously. &#8220;The
messenger just missed the 9:40. He and
the nurse will come on the 10:15.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the doctor, as if the
delay were of small consequence. &#8220;We&#8217;re
going to want your help presently, Carey,
I think. Just ask Mrs. Carey to keep Mrs.
Robeson with her for a few minutes, if she
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carey went down and gave his wife the
message, then he hurried back and stood
waiting just outside the door. And all at
once the summons came. In a breath the
doctor had changed his rôle. He spoke
sharply:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Now, Robeson&mdash;now, Carey&mdash;we&#8217;ve
waited up to the limit. Keep cool&mdash;hold
him like a rock&mdash;</i>&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Wayne Carey came down to his wife, ten
minutes later, smiled tremulously, sank into
a chair, and fell to crying like a baby&mdash;softly,
so that he could not be heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Juliet says he&#8217;ll be all right,&#8221;
murmured Judith unsteadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Carey wiped his eyes
and blew his nose. &#8220;I&#8217;m just a little unnerved,
that&#8217;s all. Lord&mdash;and he&#8217;s dropped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
off to sleep as quiet as a lamb&mdash;with Barnes
holding the gash in his throat open with a
hairpin to let the air in. When it comes
to emergency surgery I tell you it&#8217;s a lucky
thing to have an expert in the house.
Completely worn out&mdash;the little chap.
When the nurse comes they&#8217;ll get out the
whistle and sew the place up. She ought
to be here&mdash;I&#8217;ll go meet that train.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet and hurried out of
the house. Presently he was back, followed
by an erect young woman who wore
a long coat over the uniform she had not
taken time to change. Carey carried the
long black bag she had brought with
her.</p>
<p>By and by Anthony and Roger Barnes
came down. The former was pale, but as
quietly composed as ever; the latter nonchalant,
yet wearing that gleam of satisfaction
in his eye which is ever the badge
of the successful surgeon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Mrs. Carey,&#8221; said the doctor,
smiling, &#8220;why not relax that tension a
bit? The youngster is right as a trivet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s your idea of being
right as a trivet,&#8221; Judith retorted. &#8220;In
bed, with a trained nurse watching you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
and a doctor staying all night to make
sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you&mdash;what better would you
have? If it were any other boy the doctor
would have been home and in bed an hour
ago, I assure you. Carey&mdash;if you don&#8217;t
stop acting like a great fool I&#8217;ll put you to
bed too.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Carey was wringing Barnes&#8217; hand,
and the tears were running unashamed
down his cheeks. &#8220;I gave him that rooster
myself,&#8221; he said, and choked.</p>
<p>Upstairs all was quiet. The little life
was safe, rescued at the crucial moment
when interference became necessary, by the
skill and daring which do not hesitate to
use the means at hand when the authorized
tools can not be had. Every precaution
had been taken against harm from these
same unconventional means, and the doctor,
when he left his patient in the hands of
his nurse, felt small anxiety for the ultimate
outcome.</p>
<p>He said this very positively to the boy&#8217;s
father and mother, holding a hand of each
and bidding them go peacefully to sleep.
He would have slipped away then, but
they would not let him go. There were no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
tears, no fuss; but Juliet said, her eyes with
their heavy shadows of past suspense
meeting his steadily, &#8220;Roger, nothing can
ever tell you what I feel about this,&#8221; and
Anthony, gripping his friend&#8217;s hand with
a grip of steel, added: &#8220;We shall never
thank the Lord enough for having you on
hand, Roger Barnes.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when the young surgeon had gone,
warm with pleasure over the service he
had done those he loved this night, the
ones he had left behind found their self-control
had reached the ragged edge.
Turning to her husband Juliet flung herself
into his arms, and met there the
tenderest reception she had ever known.
So does a common anxiety knit hearts
which had thought they could be no
tighter bound.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Judith and Wayne Carey, walking along
silent streets in the early dawn of the day
after Christmas on their way to take their
train home, had little to say. Only once
Judith ventured an observation to her
heavy-eyed companion:</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely, such a scene as you went through
last night must diminish a trifle that envy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
you are always possessed with, when you&#8217;re
at that house.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Wayne, staring up at the wintry
sky, answered, more roughly than his wife
had ever heard him speak: &#8220;<i>No</i>&mdash;God
knows I envy them even at a time like
this!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />
<div style='margin: auto; text-align: center; padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em'>

<h2>XXIII.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Two Not of a Kind</span></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they are very pleasant rooms,&#8221;
Juliet admitted, with the air of one endeavouring
to be polite. She sat upon a
many-hued divan, and glanced from the
blue-and-yellow wall-paper to the green
velvet chairs, the dull-red carpet and the
stiff &#8220;lace&#8221; curtains. &#8220;You get the afternoon
sun, and the view opposite isn&#8217;t bad.
The vestibule seemed to be well kept, and
I rang only three times before I made you
hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The janitor promised to fix that bell,&#8221;
said Judith hastily. &#8220;Oh, I know the
colour combinations are dreadful, but one
can&#8217;t help that in rented rooms. Of course
our things look badly with the ones that
belong here. But as soon as we can we
are going to move into a still better place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to keep house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o, not just yet.&#8221; Judith hesitated.
&#8220;You seem to think there&#8217;s nothing in the
world to do but to keep house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see why. A girl doesn&#8217;t need
to assume all the cares of life the minute
she marries. Why can&#8217;t she keep young
and fresh for a while?&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet glanced toward a mirror opposite.
&#8220;How old and haggard I must be looking,&#8221;
she observed, with&mdash;it must be confessed&mdash;a
touch of complacency. The woman who
could have seen that image reflected as her
own without complacency must have been
indifferent, indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, you manage it somehow&mdash;I
suppose because Anthony takes such care
of you. But you wait till five years more
have gone over your head, and see if
you&#8217;re not tired of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m as tired of it as you are&mdash;&#8221; began
Juliet, and stopped. &#8220;But seriously, Judith,
is it nothing to you to please Wayne?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course.&#8221; Judith flushed. &#8220;But
Wayne is satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Oh, sometimes, when we
go to see you, and you make things so pleasant
with your big fire and your good things
to eat, he gets a spasm of wishing we were
by ourselves, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet shook her head. &#8220;Wayne doesn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
say a word,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and he&#8217;s as devoted
to you as a man can be. But, Judith, if
I know the symptoms, that husband of
yours is starving for a home, and&mdash;do I
dare say it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith was staring out of the window at
the ugly walls opposite. It was her bedroom
window, and the opposite walls were
not six feet away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you dare say anything,&#8221; she
answered, looking as if she were about to
cry. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I envy you, you&#8217;re so
supremely contented. I don&#8217;t think I
was made to care for children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That might come,&#8221; said Juliet softly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it would, Judith. As for Wayne,
if you could see the look on his face I&#8217;ve
surprised there more than once, when he
had little Anthony, and he thought nobody
noticed, it would make your heart ache,
dear. Don&#8217;t deny him&mdash;or yourself&mdash;the
best thing that can happen to either of you.
At least, don&#8217;t deny it for lack of a home.
I&#8217;m sure I can&#8217;t imagine Tony, Junior, in
these rooms of yours. They don&#8217;t look,&#8221;
she explained, smiling, &#8220;exactly babyish.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose to go. She looked so young and
fair and sweet as she spoke her gentle homily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
that Judith, half doubting, half believing,
admitted to herself that of one thing there
could be no question: Mrs. Anthony Robeson
envied nobody upon the face of the
earth.</p>
<p>The visits of the Robesons to the various
apartments which were in rotation occupied
by the Careys were few. Somehow it
seemed much easier and simpler for the
pair who had no children, and no housekeeping
to hamper them, to run out into
the suburbs than for their friends to get
into town. So the Careys came with
ever increasing frequency, always warmly
welcomed, and enjoyed the hours within
the little house so thoroughly that in
time the influence of the content they saw
so often began to have its inevitable effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve great news for you,&#8221; said Anthony,
coming home one March day, when little
Tony was nearing his second birthday.
&#8220;It&#8217;s about the Careys. Guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are going to housekeeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know, but Judith told me
weeks ago she supposed she should have to
come to it. Have they found a house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carey thinks he has. Judith doesn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
like the place, for about fifty good and
sufficient reasons&mdash;to her. He&#8217;s trying to
persuade her. He has an option on it for
ten days. He wants us to come out and
look at it with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About as far east of the city as we are
north. If to-morrow is a good day I
promised we would run out with them on
the ten-fifteen. I suspect they need us
badly. Wayne looks like a man distracted.
The great trouble, I fancy, is going to be
that Judith Dearborn Carey is still too
much of a Dearborn to be able to make a
home out of anything. And Carey can&#8217;t
do it alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed he can&#8217;t, poor fellow. I never
saw a man in my life who wanted a home
as badly as Wayne does. Let&#8217;s do our
best to help them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will. But the only way to do it
thoroughly is to make Judith over. Even
you can&#8217;t accomplish that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s hope, if she has agreed at all to
trying the experiment,&#8221; Juliet declared,
and thought about her friends all the rest
of the day.</p>
<p>It was but five minutes&#8217; walk, from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
suburban station where the party got off
next morning, to the house which Carey
eagerly pointed out as the four approached.</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me
what you think of it till you&#8217;ve seen the
whole thing. I know it doesn&#8217;t look
promising as yet, but I keep remembering
the photographs of your home, Robeson,
before you went at it. I&#8217;m inclined to
think this can be made right, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony and Juliet studied Carey&#8217;s choice
with interest. Judith looked on dubiously.
It was plain that if she should consent it
would be against her will.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks so commonplace and ugly,&#8221;
she said aside to Juliet, as the four completed
the tour around the house and prepared
to enter. &#8220;Your home is old-fashioned
enough to be interesting, but
this is just modern enough to be ugly.
Look at that big window in front with the
cheap coloured glass across the top. What
could you do with that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Several things,&#8221; said her friend promptly.
&#8220;You might put in a row of narrow
casement windows across the front, with
diamond panes. No&mdash;the porch isn&#8217;t attractive
with all that gingerbread work,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
but you could take it away and have
something plain and simple. The general
lines of the house are not bad. It has
been an old-fashioned house, Judith, but
somebody who didn&#8217;t know how has altered
it and spoiled it. People are always doing
that. There must have been a fanlight
over this door. You could restore it.
And do you see that quaint round window
in the gable? Probably they looked at
that and longed to do away with it, but
happily for you didn&#8217;t know how.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carey glanced curiously at his friend&#8217;s
wife, then anxiously at his own. Juliet&#8217;s
face was alight with interest; Judith&#8217;s
heavy with dissatisfaction. He wondered
for the thousandth time what made the
difference. He would have given a year&#8217;s
salary to see Judith look interested in this
desire of his heart. It was hard to push
a thing like this against the will of the only
person whose help he could not do without.
Carey was determined to have the home.
Even Judith acknowledged that she had
not been happy in any of the seven apartments
they had tried during the less than
four years of their married life. Carey
believed with all his heart that their only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
chance for happiness lay in getting away
from a manner of living which was using
up every penny he could earn without
giving them either satisfaction or comfort.
His salary would not permit him to rent
the sort of thing in the sort of neighbourhood
which Judith longed for. And if it
should, he did not believe his wife would
find such environments any more congenial
than the present one. Carey had a theory
that a woman, like a man, must be busy to
be contented. He meant to try it with his
handsome, discontented wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a pretty hall!&#8221; cried Mrs.
Robeson, with enthusiasm. &#8220;How lucky
that the vandals who made the house
over didn&#8217;t lay their desecrating hands on
that staircase.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The hall looks gloomy to me,&#8221; said
Mrs. Carey, with a disapproving glance at
the walls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;with that dingy brown
paper and the woodwork stained that
hideous imitation of oak. You can scrape
all that off, paint it white, put on a warm,
rich paper, restore your fanlight, and
you&#8217;ll have a particularly attractive hall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could see things that are not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
visible, as you seem to be able to,&#8221; sighed
Judith, looking unconvinced. &#8220;I never
did like a long, straight staircase like that.
And there&#8217;s not room to make a turn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want to, do you? It&#8217;s so
wide and low it doesn&#8217;t need to turn, and
the posts and rails are extremely good.
How about this front room?&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood in the center of the front room,
and the two men, watching her vivid face
as it glowed above her furs, noting the
capable, womanly way she had of looking
at the best side of everything and discerning
in a flash of imagination and intuition
what could be done with unpromising
material, appreciated her with that full
masculine appreciation which it is so well
worth the trouble of any woman to win.</p>
<p>Judith was not blind; she saw little by
little as Juliet went from room to room&mdash;seizing
in each upon its possibilities, ignoring
its poorer features except to suggest
their betterment, giving her whole-hearted,
friendly counsel in a way which continually
took the prospective homemakers into consideration&mdash;that
she herself was losing something
immeasurably valuable in not attempting
to cultivate these same winning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
characteristics. And in the same breath
Judith was forced to admit to herself that
she did not know how to begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is really a very pretty view from
the dining-room,&#8221; she said, as a first effort
at seeing something to admire. Both
Juliet and Anthony agreed to this statement
with a cordiality which came very near
suggesting that it was a relief to find Mrs.
Carey on the optimistic side of the discussion
even in this small detail. As for Carey, he
looked so surprised and grateful that
Judith&#8217;s heart smote her with a vigour to
which she was unaccustomed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you could use this room as a
sort of den?&#8221; she was prompted to suggest
to her husband; and such a delighted smile
illumined Carey&#8217;s face that the sight of it
was almost pathetic to his friends, who
understood his situation rather better than
he did himself. In his pleasure Carey put
his arm about his wife&#8217;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I, though?&#8221; he agreed enthusiastically.
&#8220;And you could use it for a
retreat while I was away for the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A retreat from what? Too much excitement?&#8221;
began Judith, the old habit of
scorn of everything which was not of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
city returning upon her irresistibly. But
it chanced that she caught Juliet&#8217;s eyes,
unconsciously wearing such an expression
of solicitude to see her friend complaisant
in this matter which meant so much, that
Judith hurriedly followed her ironic question
with the more kindly supplement: &#8220;But
doubtless I should have plenty, and be glad
to get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly would,&#8221; asserted Anthony.
&#8220;We never guessed how much
there would be to occupy us in the country,
but there seems hardly time to write letters.
Nobody can believe, till he tries, how much
pleasure there is in wheedling a garden into
growing, nor how well the labour makes him
sleep o&#8217; nights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I think I could sleep here,&#8221; said
Carey, and passed a hand over a brow
which was aching at that very moment.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t done that satisfactorily for six
months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do it here,&#8221; Anthony prophesied
confidently. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fine air with a good
breath of the salt sea in it, which we don&#8217;t
get. Your sleeping rooms are all well
aired and lighted&mdash;a thing you don&#8217;t always
find in more pretentious houses. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
when the paint and paper go on you&#8217;ll own
yourselves surprised at the transformation.
I was never so astonished in my life as I
was at the change in the little bedroom in
our house which has that pale yellow-and-white
stripe on the wall. It was a north
room, and the old wall was a forlorn slate,
like a thundercloud. My little artist here,
with her eye for colours, instantly announced
that she would get the sunshine
into that room. And so she did&mdash;with no
more potent a charm than that fifteen-cent
paper and a fresh coat of white paint.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carey looked at Juliet with longing in
his eye. He wanted to ask her to supervise
the alterations in his purchase, if he should
make it. But he remembered other occasions
when he had held the sayings and
doings of Mrs. Robeson before the eyes of
Mrs. Carey with disastrous result, and he
dared not make the suggestion. He hoped,
however, that Judith might be inclined to
ask the assistance of her friend, and himself
hinted at it, cautiously. But Judith, beyond
inquiring what Juliet thought of certain
possible changes, seemed inclined to shoulder
her own responsibilities.</p>
<p>Anthony left his wife upon the home-bound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
train, to return to his work; the
Careys accompanied him, so that he had
no chance to talk things over until he came
home to dinner at night. But when he saw
Juliet again almost her first words showed
him where her thoughts were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony, I can&#8217;t get those people off my
mind. Do you suppose they will ever make
a home out of anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t much genius for utilizing
raw material, I&#8217;m very much afraid,&#8221;
Anthony responded thoughtfully. &#8220;Carey
has the will, and he can furnish a moderate
amount of funds, but whether Judith can
furnish anything but objections and contrariety
I don&#8217;t dare to predict. If her
heart were in it I should have more hope of
her. There&#8217;s one thing I can tell her. If
she doesn&#8217;t set her soul to the giving the
old boy a taste of peace and rest she&#8217;ll have
him worn out before his time. A fellow who
doesn&#8217;t know how it feels to sleep soundly,
and whose head bothers him half the time,
needs looking after. He&#8217;s a slave to his
office desk, and needs far more than an
active chap like me to get out of the city as
much as he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s worried and restless, Tony.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
He&#8217;s so devoted to Judith and so anxious to
make her happy, her dissatisfaction rests
on him like a weight. Don&#8217;t you see that
every time you see them together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time&mdash;and more plainly. What&#8217;s
the matter with her anyhow, Julie? She
seemed promising enough as a girl. You
certainly found enough in her to make you
two congenial. She&#8217;s no more like you
than&mdash;electric light is like sunshine,&#8221; said
Anthony, picking up the simile with a
laugh and a glance of appreciation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judith shines in the surroundings she
was born and brought up in, misses them,
and doesn&#8217;t know how to adapt herself to
any others. She ought to have been the
wife of some high official&mdash;she could entertain
royally and have everybody at her
feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Magnificent characteristics, but mighty
unavailable in the present circumstances.
It carries out my electric-light comparison.
I prefer the sunlight&mdash;and I have it.&mdash;Poor
Carey!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hope,&#8221; said Juliet. &#8220;And if we
have the smallest chance to help, we&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, as Anthony had anticipated, there
was small chance to help. Meeting Carey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
a fortnight later, Anthony inquired after
the new home, and Carey replied with apparent
lack of enthusiasm that the house
had been leased for a term of three years,
with refusal of the purchase at the expiration
of the time. He explained that Judith
had been unwilling to burn her bridges by
buying the place outright, and that he
thought perhaps the present plan was the
better one&mdash;under these conditions. But
the fact that the house was not their own
made it seem unwise to expend very much
upon alterations beyond those of paint and
paper. With the prospect of a sale the
owner had unwillingly consented to replace
the gingerbread porch with one in better
style, but refused to do more. The big
window, with its abominable topping of
cheap coloured glass, was to remain for the
present.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think this whole arrangement is
bound to defeat my purpose,&#8221; said Carey
unhappily. &#8220;The very changes we can&#8217;t
afford to make in a rented house are the
ones Judith needs to have made to reconcile
her to the experiment. She says she
feels ill every time she comes to the house
and sees that window. She wants a porcelain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
sink in the kitchen. She would like
speaking-tubes and a system of electric
bells. We&#8217;re to have a servant&mdash;if we can
find her. We&#8217;ve put green paper on all the
downstairs rooms, and it turns out the
wrong green. I wanted a sort of corn-colour
that looked more cheerful, but it seems
green is the only thing. I don&#8217;t know
what&#8217;s the matter with me. Perhaps I&#8217;m
bilious. Green seems to be all right in
your house, but in mine it makes me want
to go outdoors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s precisely what you should do,&#8221;
Anthony advised cheerfully. &#8220;Get outdoors
all you can. Start your garden.
Mow your lawn yourself. Make over that
gravel path to your front door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only evenings,&#8221; objected Carey.
&#8220;And we&#8217;re not settled yet. The paper&#8217;s
only just on. We haven&#8217;t moved. We&#8217;re
buying furniture. We bought a sideboard
yesterday. It cost so much we had to get
a cheaper range for the kitchen than
seemed desirable, but Judith liked the sideboard
so well I was glad to buy it. I don&#8217;t
know when we shall get to living there
permanently. This furnishing business
knocks me out. We don&#8217;t seem to know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
what we want. I&#8217;d like&mdash;&#8221; he hesitated&mdash;&#8220;I
hoped Mrs. Robeson might be able to
give us the advantage of her experience,
but it turns out that Judith has a sort of
pride in doing it herself, and of course&mdash;I
presume you made some mistakes yourselves,
eh?&#8221; He suggested this with eagerness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course,&#8221; agreed Anthony readily,
though he wondered what they were, and
inwardly begged Juliet&#8217;s pardon for this
answer, given out of masculine sympathy
with his friend&#8217;s helplessness. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
come out all right,&#8221; he hastily assured
Carey. &#8220;Once you are living in the new
place things will adjust themselves. Keep
up your courage. Your daily walk to and
from the train will do wonders. Lack of
exercise will make a rainbow look gloomy
to a fellow. I think you&#8217;ve great cause for
rejoicing that Judith has agreed to try
the experiment at all. And as with all
experiments, you must be patient while it
works itself out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Carey, a gleam of hope
in his eyes; and Anthony got away. But
by himself the happier man shook his head
doubtfully. &#8220;Where everything depends
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
on the woman,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;and
you&#8217;ve married one that her Maker never
fashioned for domestic joys, you&#8217;re certainly
up against a mighty difficult proposition!&#8221;</p>

<h2>XXIV.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>The Careys Are at Home</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Wayne and Judith Carey had been keeping
house for two months before Judith was
willing to accede to her husband&#8217;s often
repeated request that they entertain the
Robesons.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been there, together and separately,
till it&#8217;s a wonder their hospitality
doesn&#8217;t freeze up,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have
them out to-morrow night, and keep them
over till next day, at least. I&#8217;d like to
have them sleep under this roof. They&#8217;d
bring us good luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One would think the Robesons were the
only people worth knowing,&#8221; said Judith,
with a petulance of which she had the grace,
as her husband stared at her, to be ashamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re the truest friends we have in
the world,&#8221; he said, with a dignity of
manner unusual with him. &#8220;Sometimes I
think they are the only people worth
knowing&mdash;out of all those on your calling
list.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We differ about that. Your ideas of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
who are worth knowing are very peculiar.
Heaven knows I&#8217;m fond of Juliet, but I get
decidedly tired of having her held up as a
model. And I haven&#8217;t been anxious to
entertain her until we were in order.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re certainly as much in order now
as we shall be for some time. Let&#8217;s have
them out. You&#8217;ll find they&#8217;ll see everything
there is to praise. It&#8217;s their way.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Anthony and Juliet were asked, and
came. Wayne&#8217;s prophecy was proven a
true one&mdash;even Judith grew complacent as
her friends admired the result of her house-furnishing.
And in truth there was much
to admire. Judith was a young woman
of taste and more or less discretion, and
if she could have had full sway in her
purchasing the result might have been
admirable. As it was, the unspoken criticism
in the minds of both the guests, as
they followed their hosts about the house,
was that Judith had struck a key-note in
her construction of a home a little too ambitious
to be wholly satisfactory.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe in buying the best of everything
as far as you go,&#8221; she said, indicating
a particularly costly lounging chair in a
corner of the living-room. &#8220;Of course
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
that was very expensive, but it will always
be right, and we can get others to go with
it. The bookcases were another high-priced
purchase, but they give an air to
the room worth paying for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve only one objection to this room,&#8221;
said Wayne with some hesitation. &#8220;As
Judith says, the things in it seem to be all
right, and it certainly looks in good taste,
if I&#8217;m any judge, but&mdash;I don&#8217;t know just
how to explain it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he hesitated again,
and smiled deprecatingly at his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak out,&#8221; said Judith. She was in a
very good humour, for her guests had shown
so fine a tact in their commendation that
she was in quite a glow of satisfaction, and
for the first time felt the pleasure of the
hostess in an attractive home. &#8220;It can&#8217;t
be a serious objection, for you&#8217;ve liked
every single thing we&#8217;ve put into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I have,&#8221; agreed Carey, eagerly
glancing about the brilliantly lit room.
&#8220;I like it all awfully well&mdash;especially in the
daylight. The corner by the window is a
famous place for reading. But, you see, I&#8217;m
so little here in the daytime, except on
Sundays. Of course I know we lack the
fireplace that makes your living-room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
jolly, but it seems as if we lack something
besides that we might have, and for the
life of me I can&#8217;t tell what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony knew by a certain curve in the
corner of his wife&#8217;s mouth that she longed
to tell him what it was. For himself, he
could not discover. He studied the room
searchingly and was unable to determine
why, attractive as it really was, it certainly
did, upon this cool May evening, lack the
look of warm comfort and hospitality of
which his own home was so full.</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly it&#8217;s because everything is so
new,&#8221; he ventured. &#8220;Rooms come to
have a look of home, you know, just by
living in them and leaving things about.
It&#8217;s a pretty room, all right, and I fancy it
will take on the friendly expression you
want when you get to strewing your books
and magazines around a little more, and
laying your pipe down on the corner of the
mantel-piece, you know&mdash;and all that. I
can upset things for you in half a minute if
you&#8217;ll give me leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have my full permission,&#8221; said
Judith, laughing. &#8220;I fancy it&#8217;s just as you
say: Wayne isn&#8217;t used to it yet. He always
likes his old slippers better than the handsomest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
new ones I can buy him. Come&mdash;dinner
has been served for five minutes.
No more artistic suggestions till afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dinner was perfect. It should have
been so, for a caterer was in the kitchen, and
a hired waitress served the viands without
disaster. As a delectable meal it was a
success; as an exhibition of Mrs. Carey&#8217;s
capacity for home making, it was something
of a failure. It certainly did not for a
moment deceive the guests. For the life
of her, as Juliet tasted course after course
of the elaborate meal, she could not help
reckoning up what it had cost. Neither
could she refrain from wondering what sort
of a repast Judith would have produced
without help.</p>
<p>After dinner, as Wayne and Anthony
smoked in front of the fireless mantel-piece
in the den, each in a more luxurious
chair than was to be found in Anthony&#8217;s
whole house, Judith took Juliet to task.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may try to disguise it,&#8221; she complained,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ve known you too long not
to be able to read you. You would rather
have had me cook that dinner myself and
bring it in, all red and blistered from being
over the stove.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>&#8220;As long as the dinner wasn&#8217;t red and
blistered you wouldn&#8217;t have been unhappy,&#8221;
Juliet returned lightly. &#8220;But you mustn&#8217;t
think that she who entertains may read my
ingenuous face, my dear. It isn&#8217;t necessary
that I attempt to convert the world to my
way of thinking. And I haven&#8217;t told you
that when Auntie Dingley goes abroad with
father again this winter I&#8217;m to have Mary
McKaim for eight whole months. I can
assure you I know how to appreciate the
comfort of having a competent cook in the
kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>She got up and crossed the room. &#8220;Judith,
what an exquisite lamp,&#8221; she observed.
&#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten that you had it. Was it
one of your wedding presents?&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith followed her to where she stood
examining an imposing, foreign-looking
lamp, with jeweled inlets in the hand-wrought
metal shade. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said
carelessly, &#8220;it&#8217;s pretty enough. I don&#8217;t
care much for lamps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to read by?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bright enough for anybody but a
blind man to read, here.&#8221; Judith glanced
at the ornate chandelier of electric lights
in the centre of the ceiling. &#8220;The rooms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
aren&#8217;t so high that the lights are out of
reach for reading.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But this is beautiful. Have you never
used it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might be used with an electric connection,
I suppose. No, I&#8217;ve never used
it as an oil lamp. I hate kerosene oil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have some in the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I think so. Wayne insisted
on getting some little hand-lamps. Something&#8217;s
always happening to the wires out
here. That&#8217;s one of the numerous joys of
living in the suburbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s fill this and try it,&#8221; Juliet suggested,
turning a pair of very bright eyes
upon her friend. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve never lit it I
don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;ve half appreciated it.
You&#8217;re neglecting one of the prettiest
sources of decoration you have in the house.
Out of sympathy for the giver, whoever he
was, you ought to let his gift have a chance
to show you its beauty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stevens Cathcart gave it to us, I believe,&#8221;
said Judith. &#8220;Here, let me have
it. I&#8217;ll fill it, since you insist. But I never
thought very much of it. It was put away
in a closet until we came here. It took up
so much room I never found a place for it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Cathcart gave it to you? That
proves my point, that it&#8217;s worth admiring.
If there&#8217;s a connoisseur in things of this
sort, it&#8217;s he. He probably picked it up in
some out-of-the-ordinary European shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smiling to herself, as if something gave
her satisfaction, Juliet awaited the return
of her hostess. She understood, from the
manner of Judith&#8217;s exit with the lamp, that
the free and easy familiarity with which
guests invaded every portion of Anthony&#8217;s
little home, was not to be made a precedent
for the same sort of thing in Judith&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The lamp reappeared, accompanied by a
lamentation over the disagreeable qualities
of kerosene oil for any use whatever.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can put electricity into this and
use it as a drop-light, if you prefer,&#8221; said
Juliet, as she lit it and adjusted the shade.
&#8220;May I set it on the big table over here?
Right in the center, please, if you don&#8217;t
mind moving that bowl of carnations.
There!&mdash;Of course you can send it back to
oblivion over there on the bookcase if you
really don&#8217;t like it.&mdash;But you do like it&mdash;don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s handsomer than I thought it was,&#8221;
Judith admitted without enthusiasm. Juliet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
glanced up at the blazing chandelier overhead.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I turn off some of this light?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;You won&#8217;t get the full beauty of
your lamp till you give it a chance by itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judith assented. Juliet snapped off three
out of the four lights, and smiled mischievously
at her friend. Then she extinguished
the fourth, so that the only luminary
left in the room was the lamp.
Judith groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you like a gloomy room like this.
I don&#8217;t. Look at it. I can hardly see
anything in the corners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a little bit. You&#8217;re so used to the
glare your eyes are not good for seeing what
I mean. Study the lamp itself a minute.
Did you ever see anything so fascinating as
the gleam through those jewels? An electric
bulb inside would add to the brilliancy,
though it&#8217;s not so soft a light to read by,
and the effect in the room isn&#8217;t so warm.
Observe those carnations under the lamplight,
honey? Come over here to the doorway
and look at your whole room under
these new conditions. Isn&#8217;t it charming?&mdash;enticing?&mdash;Let&#8217;s
draw that lovely
Morris chair up close to the table, as if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
you were expecting Wayne to come in
and read the evening paper by the lamp.
<i>There!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet softly clapped her hands, her face
shining with friendly enthusiasm. There
could be no question that the whole room,
as she had said, had taken on a new look of
homelike comfort and cheer which it had
lacked before. Even Judith was forced to
see it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks very well,&#8221; she admitted.
&#8220;But I should have more light from above.
I like plenty of light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I, if you manage it well.&#8221; Whereupon
the guest, having gained her point
and made sufficient demonstration of it,
turned the conversation into other channels.
But the lamp was not yet through
with its position of reformer. The two men,
having finished their cigars, and hearing
sounds of merriment from the adjoining
room, came strolling in. Anthony, comprehending
at a glance the change which had
come over the aspect of the room and the
cause thereof, advanced, smiling. But
Carey came to a standstill upon the threshold,
his lips drawn into an astonished
whistle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happened?&#8221; he ejaculated, and
stood staring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it?&#8221; asked his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say I did. But what&#8217;s done
it? What makes the room look so different?
It looks&mdash;why it looks like your rooms!&#8221;
he cried, gazing at Anthony.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can say nothing more flattering than
that,&#8221; said Judith, evidently not altogether
pleased. &#8220;It&#8217;s the highest compliment he
knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carey stared at the lamp. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
know we had that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Is it that
that does it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fancy it is,&#8221; said Anthony. &#8220;I never
understood it till I was taught, but it seems
to be a fact that a low light in a room gives
it a more homelike effect than a high one.
I don&#8217;t know why. It&#8217;s one of my wife&#8217;s
pet theories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must say this is a pretty convincing
demonstration of it,&#8221; Carey agreed,
sitting down in a chair in a corner, his hands
in his pockets, still studying this, to him,
remarkable transformation. &#8220;It certainly
does look like a happy home now. Before,
it was a place to receive calls in.&#8221; He
turned, smiling contentedly, to his wife.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
Something about the glance which she
returned warned him that further admiration
was unnecessary. The contented
smile faded a little. He got up and
came over to the table. &#8220;Now, let&#8217;s have
a good four-handed talk,&#8221; he proposed.</p>
<p>Two hours later, in the seclusion of the
guest-room upstairs, Anthony said under
his breath:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming on, aren&#8217;t they? Don&#8217;t
you see glimmerings of hope that some day
this will resemble a home, in a sort of far-off
way? Isn&#8217;t Judith becoming domesticated
a trifle? She didn&#8217;t get up that
dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet turned upon him a smiling face,
and laid her finger on her lip. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
tempt me to discuss it,&#8221; she warned him.
&#8220;My feelings might run away with me, and
that would never do under their very roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exemplary little guest! May I say
as much as this, then? I&#8217;d give a good deal
to see Wayne speak his mind once in a way,
without a side glance to see if Her Royal
Majesty approves.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Juliet shook her head. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
tempt me,&#8221; she begged again. &#8220;There&#8217;s
something inside of me that boils and boils
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
with rage, and if I should just take the cover
off&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I get scalded? All right&mdash;I&#8217;ll
leave the cover on. Just one observation
more. When I get inside our own four
walls again I&#8217;m going to give a tremendous
whoop of joy and satisfaction that&#8217;ll raise
the roof right off the house!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>XXV.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>The Robeson Will</span></h2>
</div>

<p>When people are busy and happy the
years may go by like a dream. So the
months rolled around and brought little
Tony past the third anniversary of his
birth, and into another summer of lusty
development. Except to the growing child,
however, time seemed to bring slight
changes to the little home under whose
roof he grew. The mistress thereof lost no
charm either for her husband or her friends&mdash;Anthony
indeed insisted that she grew
younger; certainly, as time taught her new
lessons without laying hands upon her
beauty, she gained attractiveness in every
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look as much like a girl as ever,&#8221;
Anthony said to her one morning, as dressed
for a trip into town she came out upon the
porch where he and little Tony were frolicing
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had ever a sweetly blarneying
tongue,&#8221; said she, and bestowed a parting
caress impartially upon both the persons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
before her. &#8220;I feel a bit guilty at making
a nursemaid of you for even one morning of
your vacation, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. Do your errands with
an easy conscience. I&#8217;ll enjoy looking after
the boy, and am rather glad your usual
little maid is away. That&#8217;s one thing my
vacation is for&mdash;to get upon a basis of
mutual understanding and confidence with
my son. We see too little of each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Juliet caught the early car, and left
the two male Robesons together, father and
son, waving good-bye to her from the
porch. When she was out of sight the
elder Robeson turned to the younger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, son,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to mow
the lawn. What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I is going to mow lawn, too,&#8221; announced
Tony, Junior, with decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, sir. Here we are. Get in
front of me and mind you push hard.
That&#8217;s the stuff!&#8221;</p>
<p>All went joyously for ten minutes. Then
little Tony wriggled out from between his
father&#8217;s arms and went over to the porch
step. He sat down and crossed two fat
legs. He leaned his head upon his hand,
his elbow on his knee, and watched with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
serious eyes the progress of the lawn-mower
three times across before he said wistfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;Favver, I wis&#8217; you&#8217;d p&#8217;ay wiv me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I get this job done perhaps I
will,&#8221; said Anthony, and made the grass
fly merrily. Presently he put away the
lawn-mower, and stood looking down at
the sturdy little figure in the blue Russian
blouse. &#8220;What do you want to play?&#8221;
he asked. Tony&#8217;s face lit up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Le&#8217;s play fire-endjun,&#8221; he proposed
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where shall we play the fire is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Le&#8217;s have weal fire,&#8221; said Tony eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Real fire? Well, I don&#8217;t know about
that, son,&#8221; his father responded doubtfully.
&#8220;Young persons of three are not considered
old enough to play with the real thing.
Won&#8217;t make believe do just as well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no&mdash;weal fire,&#8221; repeated the child.
&#8220;Le&#8217;s put it out wiv sqi&#8217;yt watto. P&#8217;ease,
favver&mdash;p&#8217;ease!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sqi&#8217;wt watto,&#8221; repeated Anthony,
laughing. &#8220;What do you mean by&mdash;&mdash;?
Oh, I see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; as Tony demonstrated his
meaning by running to the garden hose
which remained attached to a hydrant
behind the house. &#8220;Well, son&mdash;if I let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
you have a real fire and put it out with
real water, will you promise me never to try
anything of that sort by yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony walked over to his father and laid
a little brown fist in Anthony&#8217;s. &#8220;Aw
wight,&#8221; he said solemnly. Anthony looked
down at the clasped hands and smiled at
the serious uplifted face. &#8220;Is that the
way mother teaches you to promise her?&#8221;
he asked, with interest.</p>
<p>Tony nodded. &#8220;Aw wight,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Come on. Le&#8217;s make fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>The fire was made, out of a packing-box
brought up from the cellar. It burned
realistically down by the orchard, and was
only discovered by chance when Anthony
Robeson, Junior, happened to glance that
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Fire!&mdash;fire!</i>&#8221; he shouted, and alarmed
the fire company, who, as fire companies
should be, were ready to start on the instant.
The hose-cart, propelled by a pair of stout
legs, made a gallant dash down the edge
of the garden, followed by the hook-and-ladder
company, their equipment just three
feet long. It took energetic and skilful
work to quench the conflagration, which
raged furiously and made plenty of good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
black smoke. The fire chief rushed dramatically
about, ordering his men with ringing
commands. Once he stubbed his bare toe
and fell, and for a moment it looked as
though he must cry, but like the brave
fellow that he was he smothered his pain
behind an uplifted elbow, and in a moment
was again in the thick of the fray. His
men obeyed him with admirable promptitude,
although, contrary to the usual
custom of fire chiefs, he himself took hold
of the hose and poured its volume upon the
blazing structure.</p>
<p>When the fire was out the chief, breathless,
his blue blouse bearing the marks of
the encounter with flood and flame, sat
down upon the overturned hose-cart and
beamed upon his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vat was awful nice fire,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Le&#8217;s have anuver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another? Oh, no,&#8221; protested the company,
hastily. &#8220;No more of that just now.
Pick up your hook-and-ladder wagon and
put it back where it belongs. I&#8217;ll see to the
hose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony gently displaced the fire chief
and rolled away the hose. Then he looked
back down the garden and saw his son
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
poking among the ruins of the fire. &#8220;Come
here, Tony,&#8221; he called, &#8220;and bring the
hook-and-ladder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony came slowly, but without the toy
wagon. Anthony stood still. When the
boy reached him he said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you bring the hook-and-ladder cart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause I&#8217;m ve chief,&#8221; Tony responded
gravely. &#8220;My mens&#8217;ll bring ve cart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your men aren&#8217;t there. You&#8217;ll have
to bring it yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony shook his head. &#8220;I&#8217;m ve chief,&#8221; he
repeated, and looked his father in the eye.
Anthony understood. It was not the first
time. There were moments in one&#8217;s experience
with Anthony Robeson, Junior,
when one seemed to encounter a deadlock
in the child&#8217;s will. Reasoning and commands
were apt at such times to be alike
futile. The odd thing about it was that it
was impossible to predict when these
moments were at hand. They arose without
warning, when the boy was apparently
in the best of tempers, and they did not
seem to be the result of any previous
mismanagement on the part of those in
authority over him.</p>
<p>Of one point Anthony, Senior, was sure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
The child, like all children, and possibly
more than most, possessed a vivid imagination.
When he announced himself to be
a fire chief, there could be no question that
he believed himself to be for the time that
which he pretended to be. His father
understood, therefore, that to make progress
with the boy it was necessary to get back to
the standpoint of reality before commands
could be expected to take hold. So he sat
down on a rustic seat near Juliet&#8217;s roses
and spoke in a pleasantly matter-of-fact
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;ve been a fire chief, son,
and a good one. That was a great game.
But the game is over now, and you&#8217;re not a
fire chief any more. You&#8217;re Tony Robeson,
and the little hook-and-ladder cart is your
plaything. Father wants you to bring it
here and put it in its place in the house.
It looks a little bit like rain, and the
cart mustn&#8217;t be left out to get wet.
See?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Tony still shook his head. &#8220;My
men&#8217;ll put it in,&#8221; he said, with calmness
undisturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t any men. You played
there were some, but the play is over and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
there aren&#8217;t any men. If you don&#8217;t put
the cart in it may get wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ve chief,&#8221; said little Tony. &#8220;Chiefs
don&#8217;t draw carts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When they&#8217;ve turned back to little boys
they do. You&#8217;ve turned back to a little
boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I hasn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Tony, and his eyes
met his father&#8217;s unflinchingly. &#8220;I&#8217;s going
to be a chief all ve time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The argument seemed unanswerable.
Anthony considered swiftly what to do.
He studied the grave brown eyes an instant
in silence, their beauty and the inflexibility
in their depths appealing to him with equal
force. He loved the tough little will.
He recognised it as his own&mdash;the same
powerful quality which had brought him
thus far on the road to fortune after being
landed at the furthermost end from the
goal. He would not for worlds deal with
his son&#8217;s will in any but the way which
should seem to him wisest.</p>
<p>He rose from his seat. He spoke quietly
but with force. &#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;If you&#8217;re still a fire chief, of course you&#8217;re
too big to play. I&#8217;m much obliged to you
for putting out my fire. But now that it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
out I don&#8217;t want your hook-and-ladder in
my garden any longer. When your men
take it away I shall be glad. But of course
we can&#8217;t play any more till you stop being
a fire chief and the hook-and-ladder is back
in its corner in the nursery. Good-bye.
When you are ready to be Tony Robeson
again, you&#8217;ll find me in my den.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled at his son and walked away.
Tony watched him go. Tony&#8217;s hands were
clasped behind his back, his legs planted
wide apart.</p>
<p>Anthony, Senior, found it difficult to remain
in the den. He was obliged to keep
track of a small figure in a blue blouse
from whichever of the various windows
commanded the doings of that young
person. He perceived that the fire chief
was still holding dominion over the scene.</p>
<p>At the end of an hour small footsteps
were heard approaching. Anthony looked
up from the letter he was attempting to
write. &#8220;Favver, may I have a bread and
butter?&#8221; asked a pleasant voice. Anthony
turned about in his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the hook-and-ladder in the nursery?&#8221;
he inquired gravely.</p>
<p>Tony shook his head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then you are still the fire chief.
Fire chiefs go to the hotel for their bread
and butter. I haven&#8217;t any bread and
butter for the fire chief.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned back to his desk. The small
figure in the doorway stood still a moment,
then the footsteps were heard retreating.
Five minutes later, Anthony, looking out,
saw Tony careering about the garden on a
hobby-horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obstinate little duffer,&#8221; he said affectionately
to himself. &#8220;He&#8217;s playing go to
the hotel, I suppose. Perhaps when that
imagination of his gets to work at hypothetical
bread and butter he&#8217;ll find the
reality preferable to the fancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a short time Anthony again reconnoitred.
The garden was empty. He
looked out at the front of the house. No
small figure in blue was to be seen. He
went out and took a turn about the place.
He called the boy; there was no response.
From past experience and from the statements
of Juliet and the young girls of the
neighbourhood, whom, at various times,
she was in the habit of engaging to assist
her in the oversight of the child at his
play, he knew that Tony had a trick of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
getting himself out of sight in an incredibly
brief space of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a fire chief he may consider himself
free to do what he pleases,&#8221; said Anthony
to himself, and set about a thorough
search of the place, having no doubt that
at any moment he should come upon the
boy carrying out the details of his imaginary
vocation. After a time he went back into
the house and scoured it from top to bottom.
And when, even here, there was to be discovered
no trace of the child, he began to
feel a slight uneasiness.</p>
<p>There was no source of immediate danger
to a stray child in the neighbourhood, of
which he was aware, except the electric
line, and little Tony had never manifested
the slightest inclination to approach this by
himself. There were no open ponds, no
traps of any kind for the incautious feet of
a three-year-old. Everybody knew Tony,
and everybody admired and loved him, so
that, as Anthony took up his hat and
started upon a more extended search, he
had no doubt whatever of finding the runaway
without delay.</p>
<p>In a very short time it became a rousing
of the neighbourhood. It was Saturday,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
and all the children who knew Tony were
at hand. They were soon eagerly searching
for him near and far, without finding the
slightest trace of his passing. Anthony, now
thoroughly alarmed, telephoned in every
direction, warned every police station in the
city, and took every possible step for the
discovery of the child. It occurred to him
with tremendous force that the boy might
have been stolen. Such things did happen.
It seemed almost the only way to account
for such a sudden and mysterious disappearance.</p>
<p>Before it seemed possible two hours had
slipped past. And now, on every car
which whirled by the corner, Anthony
began to expect Juliet. He dreaded yet
longed to see her. He turned cold at the
thought of telling her the situation, yet at
the same time he felt as if she might have
some sort of a solution ready which nobody
else had thought of. And while, still
searching over and over the entire ground,
he kept watch of the arriving cars, he saw
his wife suddenly appear. He went to
meet her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she said, the instant her
eye met his.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s all right, dear,&#8221; he told her,
as quietly as he could, &#8220;but somehow we
can&#8217;t find Tony. He disappeared during
five minutes when I was in the house&mdash;too
short a time for him to have got very far
away, but&mdash;we can&#8217;t find him. Do you
think he may be hiding? Does he ever
hide himself so effectually as that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The bright colour in her face had slipped
out of it on the instant, for he could not
keep the anxiety out of his voice. But
she said no word of reproach, nor did she
lose command of herself in any way.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long has he been gone?&#8221; she asked,
going straight toward the house, Anthony
close behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;nearly two hours.
I will tell you what happened. It is possible
something I said is responsible for all
this, though I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was going swiftly about the house,
as he told her the story of his attempt to
teach the boy a lesson, and she was listening
closely to every word as she examined for
herself each nook and corner. She disclosed
several possible hiding places of which
Anthony had not thought, explaining that
Tony knew them all and sometimes betook
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
himself to them in the course of various
games. The two came out upon the porch,
and Juliet stood still, thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have done everything to intercept
him, if he should really have&mdash;got far
away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything I can think of, except start
out myself. I am ready to do that, if you
think best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until I have gone over the neighbourhood
myself. I don&#8217;t believe he is far
away&mdash;I believe he is near. He may have
heard every call you and the children
have made, and wouldn&#8217;t answer. If by
any chance his pride has been a little hurt,
he is very likely to do this sort of thing.
Wait&mdash;have you looked&mdash;I wonder if the
children know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She was off without stopping to explain,
through the garden and down the old
willow-bordered path by the brook. Anthony
followed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been down here a
dozen times,&#8221; he called. &#8220;The brook is too
shallow to hurt him, and he&#8217;s certainly not
anywhere on it within a mile. The children
have been all over the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Juliet did not pause. She ran along
the path for some distance, then turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
abruptly at a point where an abandoned lot
filled with stumps joined the area by the
brook. She made her swift way among
these stumps, Anthony following, his hope
rising as he noted the directness of his
wife&#8217;s aim. At the biggest stump she
came to a standstill, carefully swung out-ward
like a door a great slab of bark, and
disclosed a hollow. The sunlight streamed
in upon a little heap of blue, and a tangled
brown mass of hair. Anthony Robeson,
Junior, lay fast asleep in his cunningly
devised retreat.</p>
<p>Without a word his father stood looking
down at the boy&#8217;s flushed cheeks. Then
he turned to Juliet, standing beside him,
smiling through the tears which had not
come until the anxiety was past. His own
eyes were wet.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a bad scare,&#8221; he said softly.
&#8220;Thank God it&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he stooped and gently lifted the
fire chief and carried him home without
waking him. Twenty children flocked joyfully
from all about to see, and hushed
their shouts of congratulation at Juliet&#8217;s
smiling warning.</p>
<p>Anthony went alone down the garden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
to the place where the hook-and-ladder
cart had stood. It was still there. He
stood and looked at it, his eyes very tender
but his lips firm. &#8220;The little chap didn&#8217;t
give in,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;It&#8217;s going
to be hard to make him, but for the sake
of the Robeson will I think we&#8217;ll have to
take up the job where we left it. I&#8217;d
mightily like to flunk the whole business
now, but I should be a pretty weak sort of
a beggar if I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>When little Tony had wakened from his
nap, and had been washed and brushed
and fed, and made fresh in a clean frock,
his mother brought him to his father.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this Tony Robeson?&#8221; Anthony asked
soberly. Tony considered for a moment,
then shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;s ve fire chief,&#8221; he said, with polite
stubbornness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have your men put away the hook-and-ladder
cart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, favver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they going to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell vem to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, son,&#8221; said Anthony. &#8220;I could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
make the fire chief put away the cart.
I&#8217;m stronger than he is, you know. I
could make him walk out to where it lies
in the garden, and I could make his hands
pick it up and carry it into the house, and
then it would be done.&mdash;Don&#8217;t you think
I could?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony considered. &#8220;Es, I fink &#8217;ou could,&#8221;
he admitted. Evidently the question was
one he could reflect upon from the standpoint
of the outsider.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to do that. I want
Tony Robeson to put the cart away
because his father asks him to do it. Don&#8217;t
you think he ought to do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I isn&#8217;t Tony Robeson, I&#8217;se ve fire
chief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you the fire chief when you woke
up, and mother washed you and dressed
you and gave you your lunch? I don&#8217;t
think she thought you were. If you had
been the fire chief she would have left you
to take care of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tony thought about it. &#8220;I dess I&#8217;se
Tony wiv muvver,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you aren&#8217;t Tony with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The thick locks shook vehemently in the
sir with the negative response. &#8220;I said I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
was ve fire chief, and I&#8217;se got to <i>be</i> ve
fire chief,&#8221; he reiterated.</p>
<p>Without question it was a battle of
wills. But Anthony&#8217;s mind was made up.
For lack of time to deal with them previous
similar issues had been dodged in various
ways, compromises had been effected. It
was plain that argument and reasoning,
the wiles of the affectionately wise adversary
who does not want to bring the matter
to a direct conflict, had been tried. Anthony
could see no way out except to
dominate the child by the force of his own
resolute character. It was not the way
by which he wanted to obtain the mastery,
but it was becoming plain to him that, in
this case, at least, it was the only way left.</p>
<p>His face grew stern all at once, his eyes,
though still kind, met his son&#8217;s with determination.
&#8220;Tony,&#8221; he said very gravely&mdash;and
there was a new quality in his tone to
which the child was not accustomed&mdash;&#8220;You
are not the fire chief now. You
are Tony Robeson. <i>I shall not let you be
the fire chief any longer.</i> Do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no threat in the words, only
a decisiveness of the sort before which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
men give way, because they see that
there is no alternative. Tony stared into
his father&#8217;s eyes curiously. His own grew
big with wonder, with something which
was not alarm, but akin to it. He gazed
and gazed, as if fascinated. Anthony&#8217;s
look held his; the man&#8217;s powerful eyes
did not flinch&mdash;neither did the boy&#8217;s. It
is possible that both pulses quickened a
beat.</p>
<p>Little Tony drew his eyes away at last,
turned and started for the door. Silently
Anthony watched him as he reached for the
knob, turned again, and looked back at his
father. On the very threshold the child
stood still and stared back. His brown
eyes filled, his red lips quivered. The stern
face which watched his melted into a winning
smile, and Anthony held out his arms.
An instant longer, and his son had run
across the floor and flung himself into
them.</p>
<p>When the childish storm of tears had
quieted, and several big hugs had been
exchanged, Anthony set the boy down upon
the floor and took his hand. Silently the
two walked out of the house and down the
garden. The hook-and-ladder cart stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
patiently waiting, just where it had waited
all day. Little Tony ran to it and picked
it up. Over his exquisite face broke the
first smile that had been seen there since
the earliest disregarded command of the
morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ve fire chief&#8217;s gone,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He
was a bad fire chief.&#8221;</p>
<p>So together the man and the boy escorted
the hook-and-ladder cart to the nursery,
and backed it carefully into its stall, between
the milk wagon and the automobile.
Then the child went to his play. But the
man drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would rather manage a hundred
striking workmen,&#8221; he said to himself with
emphasis.</p>

<p>While little Tony had been growing,
waxing strong and sturdy: while Juliet had
been tending and training him, learning,
as every mother does, more than she could
impart: Anthony, in his place, had not
stood still. The strength and determination
he had from the first hour put into
his daily work had begun to tell. His
position in a great mercantile establishment
had steadily advanced as he had
made himself more and more indispensable
to its heads.</p>
<p>Cathcart, the successful architect, began
to talk about a new home for the man into
whose hands Henderson and Henderson
were putting large interests to manage
for them, and whose salary, he asserted,
must now justify, indeed call for, life under
more ideal surroundings than the little home
in the unfashionable suburb which poverty
had at first made necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me draw some plans for you,&#8221;
urged Cathcart, one evening in June, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
he had run out to see his friend. Juliet
was by chance away, and Cathcart took
advantage of this to call Anthony&#8217;s attention,
in a politely frank fashion, to
the shortcomings of his present residence.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all right in its way,&#8221; he said, standing
upon a corner of the lawn with Anthony,
and surveying the house critically.
&#8220;Mrs. Robeson certainly deserves full
credit for the admirable way in which
she restored the old house and added
just the changes in keeping with its possibilities.
I&#8217;ve always said it couldn&#8217;t have
been better done, with the means you&#8217;ve
told me you were able to put at her disposal.
But the place is too small for you
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we feel it so,&#8221; said Anthony
tentatively, strolling beside Cathcart
along the edge of the lawn, his hands in his
pockets, lifting friendly eyes at the little
house. &#8220;Since we put in the bathroom&mdash;that
small room off the upper hall, you
know&mdash;and added the nursery and den,
we&#8217;re very comfortable. The furnace keeps
us warm as toast, and we&#8217;re soon to have
the water system out here, so we won&#8217;t
have to depend upon our present expedients.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
I&#8217;m fond of the place, and I&#8217;m confident
Mrs. Robeson is devoted to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can understand that,&#8221; agreed Cathcart.
&#8220;Of course, the spot where you
began life together will always have its
charm for you both&mdash;in fact the sentiment
of the matter may blind you to the real
inadequacies of the place for a man in your
position.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My position isn&#8217;t so stable that I want
to build a marble palace on it yet,&#8221; said
Anthony, a humorous twinkle in his eye.
He enjoyed watching another man man&oelig;uvre
for his favourable hearing of a
scheme. It was an art in which he was
himself accomplished; it was one of the
points of his value to Henderson and
Henderson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody knows that you&#8217;re in a fair
way to become head man with the Hendersons,&#8221;
said Cathcart, &#8220;and everybody also
knows that you might as well have struck
a gold-mine. It&#8217;s superb, the way you
have come into the confidence of those
old conservatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all well enough; but I don&#8217;t see
that it entails upon me the duty of laying
out all I&#8217;ve saved on a new house. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
know what you fellows are&mdash;when you begin
to draw plans your love of the ideal runs
away with the other man&#8217;s pocketbook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; declared Cathcart. &#8220;Particularly
when he&#8217;s a friend and you understand
just what he can afford to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you talk about enlarging the
old house? That&#8217;s much more likely to
appeal to my desires.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two had reached the back of the
house and were close by the kitchen windows.
Cathcart reached up and took hold
of a sill. With a strong hand he wrenched
and pounded about the window, until he
succeeded in showing that it was old and
uncertain.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why,&#8221; he said, dusting his hand
with his handkerchief. &#8220;The house is old&mdash;fairly
rotten in places. The minute you
began to enlarge it in any ambitious way
you&#8217;d find it would be cheaper to tear
it down and begin again. But the site,
Robeson&mdash;the site isn&#8217;t desirable. The
place is respectable enough, but it has no
future. The good building is all going
south, not north, of the city. You don&#8217;t
want to spend a lot of money here&mdash;you
couldn&#8217;t sell out except at a loss.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your arguments are good, very good,&#8221;
admitted Anthony; &#8220;so good that I&#8217;d like
to put you on your mettle to draw me a set
of plans for just the sort of thing you think
I ought to have&mdash;or Mrs. Robeson ought
to have, for she&#8217;s the one to be considered.
Anything will do for me. I&#8217;ll let you do
this&mdash;on one condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Name it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you also do your level best to
demonstrate to me what a clever man and
an artist of your proportions could make
out of this house, provided he really wanted
to show the extent of his ability. Now,
that&#8217;s fair. If you really care to convince
me you won&#8217;t fool with this proposition,
you&#8217;ll make a study of the one problem as
thoroughly as you do of the other, and let
me decide the case on its merits. If I
thought you weren&#8217;t giving the old house
a fair chance I should take up its cause out
of pure affection.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled at Cathcart&#8217;s discontented face
with so brilliant a good humour that the
architect cleared up.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Jove, Robeson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I think
I see what endears you to the Hendersons.
I wouldn&#8217;t have said you could have induced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
me to try my hand at the old house,
but I&#8217;ll be hanged if I don&#8217;t follow your
instructions to the letter&mdash;and win out,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Anthony. &#8220;And don&#8217;t
mention it to my wife. We&#8217;ll keep it for
a surprise; and I promise you when the
time comes I won&#8217;t prejudice her in any
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cathcart drew out a notebook and pencil
and entered some memoranda on the spot,
while Anthony, coming up on the piazza of
the dining-room, laid upon the old Dutch
house-door a hand which seemed to caress
it. He was wondering if by any possible
magic Cathcart could create, in the rarest
abode in the world, a new door which he
should ever care to enter as he now cared
to enter this.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said Juliet decidedly, &#8220;you&#8217;re
wrong about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I know,&#8221; returned Anthony with
emphasis, &#8220;that you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two faced each other. They were
walking through a short stretch of woodland,
which lay as yet untouched by the
hand of suburban property owners. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
was a favourite ground for the diversions
of the Robesons, when they had not
time to spend in getting farther away.
They had been strolling through it now,
in the early June evening, discussing a
matter relative to the investment of a
certain moderate sum of money which
had come into Anthony&#8217;s hands. It developed
that their ideas about it differed
radically.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not safe to do as you propose,&#8221; said
Juliet.</p>
<p>&#8220;To do what you propose would be only
one better than tying it up in an old stocking&mdash;or
putting it away in the coffee pot.
It&#8217;s essentially a woman&#8217;s plan&mdash;no man
would do it the honour of considering it a
moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet flushed brilliantly. Even in Anthony&#8217;s
cheek the colour rose a little. Their
eyes met with a challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Juliet proudly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
offer no more woman&#8217;s plans. Invest the
money as you like. Then, when you&#8217;ve
lost it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony&#8217;s eyes flashed. &#8220;When I&#8217;ve
lost it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, and turned away
with a gesture of impatience. Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
stopped short. &#8220;That isn&#8217;t like you,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>Juliet stared at him an instant. Then
she shut her lips together and walked on in
silence. Anthony shut his lips together
also. It was not their habit to indulge in
sharp altercation. While both had decided
ideas about things, both were also much
too well bred to be willing to allow differences
of opinion&mdash;which must arise as
inevitably as two human beings live under
the same roof&mdash;to degenerate into the
deplorable thing commonly referred to as
a quarrel.</p>
<p>When they had proceeded a few rods
Juliet turned abruptly off from the path
and picked up from the ground a slender
straight stick, evidently cut and trimmed
by some boy and then thrown aside. She
looked about her and after some search
found another, of similar size, untrimmed.
She held out the latter to Anthony. He
accepted it with a look of surprise. Then
she walked into the path in front of him,
stood stiff and straight, her small heels
together, and made him the fencer&#8217;s salute.
&#8220;<i>On guard!</i>&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>His lips relaxing, Anthony grasped his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
stick and fell into position. A moment
more and two accomplished fencers were
engaged in close combat.</p>
<p>Juliet happened to be wearing a trim
linen skirt of short walking length, which
impeded her movements as slightly as anything
not strictly adapted to the exercise
could do. Although her fencing lessons
were some years past, the paraphernalia
belonging both to herself and Anthony
were in the house, and an occasional bout
with the masks and foils was a means of exercise
and diversion which both thoroughly
enjoyed. Although Juliet was no match
for the superior skill and endurance of her
husband, she was nevertheless no mean
antagonist, and her alertness of eye and
hand usually gave him sufficient to do to
make the encounter a stimulating one.</p>
<p>On the present occasion Anthony, challenged
to combat with his coat and cuffs on,
and wielding the more awkward weapon
of the two impromptu foils, found himself
distinctly at a disadvantage. Moreover,
he was at the moment not precisely in the
mood for fun, and he began to defend himself
with a somewhat lazy indifference.
After a minute or two, however, he discovered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
that his adversary&#8217;s slightly ruffled
temper was inspiring her hand and wrist
to distinctly effective work, and he found
himself forced to look to his methods.</p>
<p>Attack and parade, disengagement and
thrust&mdash;the battle was waged over the uneven
ground of the wood. And presently
Anthony discovered that the richly glowing
face opposite his was a smiling one. The
absurdity of the match struck him irresistibly
and he smiled in return. He
tripped a little over an obtruding oak-root,
and Juliet took advantage of her opportunity
to press him hard. He fended off the
attack and himself assumed the aggressive.
An instant more and he had disarmed
her and had thrown his own stick flying
after hers. Both were laughing heartily
enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive the trick,&#8221; cried Anthony. &#8220;A
man must disarm his wife when she becomes
his enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Breathless, Juliet sank upon a small
knoll, her hand at her side. &#8220;If I&#8217;d been
dressed for it&mdash;&#8221; she panted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need coaching on your time thrusts,
but you gave me plenty to do as it was,&#8221;
Anthony admitted. &#8220;More than that,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
you&#8217;ve presented me with a chance to recover
my equilibrium. I was hot inside
before. Now it&#8217;s all on the outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down at her affectionately.
She smiled back. &#8220;I was crosser than
sticks,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I really can&#8217;t imagine
why, now. I apologise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I.&#8221; He threw himself down on
the ground at her feet, lay flat on his back,
his clasped hands behind his head, and
gazed up into the tree-tops.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take your advice into careful consideration,&#8221;
said he.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you won&#8217;t do anything rash,&#8221;
said she, and they both laughed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much more diplomatic that sort
of talk is,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;Why do we
ever allow ourselves to use any other?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we are human, I suppose.&#8221;
Juliet was putting a mass of waving brown
hair, disordered by the fight, into shape
again. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t nice. We don&#8217;t do it
often. To-night you came home tired, and
found a wife who had been entertaining
people from town all the afternoon. But
it&#8217;s all right now, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She bent forward, and Anthony took
her outstretched hand in his own and gave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
it a grip which made it sting. He began
to whistle cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should we be happier if we never disagreed?&#8221;
she asked thoughtfully.</p>
<p>The whistle stopped. &#8220;Jupiter, no! I
want a thinking being to talk things over
with, not a mental pincushion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&mdash;Isn&#8217;t it lovely here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Delightful.&mdash;Julie, do you know we&#8217;ll
have been married five years next September?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t know it, to look at you,&#8221;
he observed. He rolled upon his left side
and regarded her from under intent brows.
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t grown a day older.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s a compliment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s meant for one. Do you know you&#8217;re
a beauty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never was one and never shall be,&#8221;
she answered laughing, but she could not
object to the obvious sincerity of his
opinion as he delivered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re near enough to satisfy me.
I&#8217;d rather have your good looks than all
the&mdash;Well, I sat in front of a newly married
pair on the way home to-night&mdash;that
fellow Scrivener and his bride. <i>She&#8217;s</i> what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
people call a raving beauty, I suppose. I
wouldn&#8217;t have her in the house at a dollar
an hour. She&#8217;s a whiner. Had him doing
something to satisfy her whim every
minute. I heard him trying to tell her
about something that interested him, but
she couldn&#8217;t take time from herself to
listen. His voice had a note of fatigue in
it, already, or I&#8217;m not Robeson. I tell you,
Juliet&mdash;that&#8217;s the sort of thing that makes
a bachelor vow to stay single, and he can&#8217;t
be blamed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose a bachelor had overheard us
half an hour ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad none did&mdash;but if he had it
wouldn&#8217;t have disgusted him the way the
other sort of thing did me to-day. A
brisk little altercation is nothing, with unlimited
hours of friendliness and understanding
before and after. But a perpetual
drizzle of fault finding and exactions&mdash;would
make a fellow go hang himself. Mrs.
Robeson, do you know, you&#8217;re a very
exceptional young person?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In what way, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever you do, you never nag. I&#8217;ve
an awful suspicion that Judith Carey
nags. You know how to let a man alone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
when he&#8217;s in the mood for being alone. She
never does. Carey had me out there not
long ago, for what he called a quiet, confidential
talk on some business matters.
We went into what is supposed to be his
private room and shut the door. Probably
she came to that door not less than twelve
times during that two hours. She called
Carey away on every sort of pretext.
Once she got him to do a stroke of work for
her that took up at least ten minutes
neither of us could spare. And she looked
like a thundercloud every time I caught a
glimpse of her face. Cæsar!&mdash;think of
having to live with that sort of person. No
wonder Carey looks old before his time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly unfortunate. But I&#8217;m
not an exception, Tony. There are plenty
of women who know when to keep out of
the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, they&#8217;re erratic on some other
line, that&#8217;s all. You&#8217;re absolutely the only
thoroughly sweet and sane woman I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear boy! Remember how snappish
I was just this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was grouchy enough to match it. I
tell you, Julie&mdash;the women who don&#8217;t talk
you to death on every subject, important
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
or trivial, bore you with idiotic questions or
impertinence about your affairs. How do
I know so much about &#8217;em? My dear,
dozens of them come into the office every
day, and Mr. Henderson has acquired a
habit lately of turning them all over to me.
I earn a double salary every hour I spend
that way&mdash;wish I could put in a demand
for it. Speaking of salaries, dear&#8221;&mdash;Anthony
suddenly sat up&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve no right to
be grouchy, for I&#8217;m promised another
advance next month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221; She put out her hand, and
the two shook hands vigorously again, like
the pair of comrades they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Juliet,&#8221; said her husband, watching her
face closely. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a happy five years,
hasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A happy five years, Tony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean it?&#8221; He smiled at her.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve never been sorry?&#8221; Then he got
to his feet and held out his hand again to
help her up. &#8220;The mortal combat we
engaged in gave you a magnificent colour,&#8221;
he commented, and passed affectionate fingers
across the smooth cheek near his
shoulder. &#8220;Sweetheart&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he drew her
into his arms&mdash;&#8220;I may fence with you once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
in a while with sharp words for weapons,
but&mdash;do you know how I love you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s strange, isn&#8217;t it?&mdash;after all these
years. To be really up-to-date, we should
long since have become interested each in
some other&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A hand came gently but effectually upon
his mouth. He kissed the hand. &#8220;No, I
won&#8217;t say it. It&#8217;s a cynical philosophy,
and I&#8217;ll not take its language on my lips&mdash;not
with my wife in my arms, giving the
lie to that sort of thing. Julie, we&#8217;re
not sentimentalists because we still care&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who thinks we are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of envious skeptics, I&#8217;ll wager.
I see it in their green-eyed glances. They
can&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s genuine. Dear&mdash;is it
genuine? Look up, and tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up, and seeing his heart in his
eyes, met his deep caress with a tenderness
which told him more than she could have
put into the words she suddenly found it
impossible to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know Roger Barnes was back?&#8221;
asked Wayne Carey of Anthony Robeson,
on the evening of the twenty-fifth of June,
as the two met on the street corner from
which Anthony was to take his car. Electrics
ran within a few rods of his home now,
but they ran only at fifteen-minute intervals
and were difficult to catch.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. To stay this time, I hope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Off again to-morrow. Never saw such
a fellow&mdash;restless as a fish. Been working
all winter in Vienna&mdash;off to-morrow on the
Overland Limited to sail Saturday for
Hongkong. Goes to do a special operation
on the Emperor&#8217;s brother or some swell of
the sort. He&#8217;s been doing some mighty
slick operating, according to the medical
review I ran across in a throat specialist&#8217;s
office.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must see him. Where is he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At your house now, more than likely.
Said he&#8217;d got to see you, and if you haven&#8217;t
seen him yet you&#8217;re sure to before he goes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
to-morrow night. By the way, Anthony,
do you know what we heard lately about
Rachel Redding&mdash;Huntington? That she
wasn&#8217;t married to Huntington till the night
he died, almost three years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess it&#8217;s straight, too,&#8221; pursued Carey.
&#8220;Queer she should have kept it all this time.
Didn&#8217;t Juliet hear from her at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only once or twice, I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her father and mother both died last
winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The man who told me was a traveller.
Said she and Huntington&#8217;s mother were
coming back to live East again. He was
an Eastern man himself&mdash;knew Huntington,
and got interested when he heard the
name out in Arizona. &#8216;Alexander Huntington&#8216;s&#8217;
rather an uncommon name, you
know. But what could have been her
motive for keeping everything so still?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no idea,&#8221; said Anthony, and let
Carey talk on by himself till the car came.
He was unwilling to discuss Rachel Redding&#8217;s
affairs on a street corner even with
Wayne Carey, because she was Juliet&#8217;s
friend. But he had an idea as to why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
Rachel had been so reserved about herself.
There were three men in the East whose
interest in Huntington&#8217;s life or death had
not been an altogether unbiased one. He
could understand that the girl would not
be eager to declare herself free to them,
though the fact of Huntington&#8217;s death had
reached them soon after its occurrence. But
this other fact&mdash;that she had married him
only at the last moment&mdash;it was obvious
that the sort of girl Rachel Redding was
would never make capital out of that
strange occurrence, whatever its explanation
might be. That Roger Barnes knew
nothing of it he was quite certain.</p>
<p>He missed Juliet from the corner where
she and the boy usually met him, and
hurrying on to the house came upon his
wife just as she was leaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t realise I was late, dear,&#8221;
she said, while Anthony swung his little
son up to his shoulder, eliciting triumphant
shouts as a reward. &#8220;Tony, Rachel is
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Rachel?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush&mdash;yes; she&#8217;s upstairs, and her window
is open. Walk down the orchard with
me and I&#8217;ll tell you. Her coming, an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
hour ago, was what made me forget the
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carey was talking about her this afternoon,&#8221;
said Anthony, strolling by her side
and carrying on a frolic with the boy at the
same time. &#8220;He&#8217;d just heard a singular
thing&mdash;that she wasn&#8217;t married to Huntington
till the very night he died.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She told me. She&#8217;s going away to-night,
she insists; but I shall not let her.
No, Mr. Huntington wouldn&#8217;t let her marry
him. After they went away he said he
wouldn&#8217;t take her unless he got well. Tony,
he was a fine character; in our sympathy
for Roger Barnes we haven&#8217;t appreciated
him. It was only at the last that he let
her do it. She found out how happy it
would make him then, and she would have
it so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad she did&mdash;poor fellow. Juliet,
Roger Barnes is in town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221; Juliet stopped, her breath
catching. &#8220;Oh, Tony&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Came day before yesterday&mdash;leaves to-morrow
night for Hongkong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony!&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony looked down at her, smiling.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a situation for you. Can you be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
expected to keep your friendly hands off
that possibility?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t go away without coming to
see us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most certainly not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he will naturally come to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more than probable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony, I won&#8217;t be trying to manage
fate&mdash;that&#8217;s what the doctor calls it&mdash;if
I keep Rachel here until after&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until after the Overland Limited leaves
for San Francisco? Well, fate needs a
little assistance once in a while. I think
you may legitimately persuade Rachel to
stay, if you can. What is her hurry, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t find out, except that I imagine
she&#8217;s afraid of meeting one of the men she
most assuredly would meet if they knew
she had come. She thinks Roger Barnes
is in Vienna still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She does? Ye gods! I think my knees
will begin to tremble if I see their meeting
imminent. Come, son, let&#8217;s try a race to
the house. I&#8217;ll give you to the big, crooked
apple tree. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;go!&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet followed more slowly, thinking
busily. Rachel had been very decided about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
going back into the city that night. Mrs.
Huntington, Senior, was with friends, who
had begged her daughter&#8217;s acceptance of
their hospitality, and for the elder woman&#8217;s
sake she had acquiesced. Rachel was a
keeper of promises, Juliet knew. And to
tell her of the probability of the doctor&#8217;s
appearance would be a doubtful means
of securing her detention. But if, for any
reason, the doctor should fail to appear&mdash;Juliet
made up her mind that she would
give fate her chance until nine o&#8217;clock that
night. If by that time Barnes had not
come&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Juliet looked on eagerly while Anthony
greeted Rachel. Her friend had never
seemed to her so lovely as now, in her simple
black gown, accentuating, as it did, the
deep tone of her hair and eyes. Her face
had gained in colour and contour in the
Arizona climate&mdash;its tints were richer. The
delicacy of her features was not changed,
but their beauty was greater.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve lived much outdoors, I see,&#8221;
said Anthony, when dinner was over and
the three had gone out upon the porch,
&#8220;and it&#8217;s been good for you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve even slept outdoors,&#8221; Rachel told
them, &#8220;fully half the year; and ridden
horseback every day. I can&#8217;t quite think
how the electrics are going to seem in place
of my gallop on Scot. The people on the
ranch where we were have simply made
me do the things they did. The owner was
a dear old gentleman; he gave me Scot.
He wanted to send him after me; but nurses
have small use for horses, I believe,&#8221; she
ended, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the plan, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s what I can do best, I think.
I am to enter the training-school the first
of July, at the Larchmont Memorial
Hospital.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager tremendous odds you don&#8217;t,&#8221;
thought Anthony, &#8220;in spite of that confident
tone. If Roger Barnes looks in to-night
it&#8217;s all up with your plans&mdash;or make
a bigger fight than even you can do. A
man who can&#8217;t stay in his own town because
you are out of it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He was sitting&mdash;purposely&mdash;where he
faced the road. He had considerately
offered Rachel a chair with her back to the
highway. Juliet was swinging lightly in
the hammock behind the vines. Anthony,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
talking on about Arizona and the Larchmont
Memorial, kept an eye on the approach
to the house from the corner where
visitors always left the car. His watch was
rewarded at length by the sight of a figure
rapidly turning the corner and making
straight for the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re in for it,&#8221; he thought.
&#8220;From now on the question with Juliet
and me will be how we can most gracefully
efface ourselves without seeming to do it.
If I remember this young person correctly
she&#8217;s a little difficult to leave unchaperoned
against her will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Out of the corner of his eye he kept track
of the approaching figure. It was coming
on at a great pace, and in the twilight could
be seen looming taller and taller as it crossed
the road and turned in across the lawn, making
a short cut according to Barnes&#8217;s own
fashion, so that the coming footsteps were
noiseless, even to the moment when the
figure reached the porch itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for it,&#8221; thought Anthony, feeling
as if the curtain were about to ascend on
the fourth act of a play, when the third had
ended amidst all possible excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found the roses blooming just as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
used to do, at the side of the house&#8221;&mdash;Rachel&#8217;s
warm, contralto voice was answering
a question from Juliet&mdash;&#8220;only so untended.
I think I shall have to come out
again before I begin my work, to look after
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony did not turn as the step
he had been watching for sounded upon
the porch. To save his life he could not
help keeping his eyes upon Rachel&#8217;s face.
Rachel herself looked up with the air of
the visitor who does not know the guests
of the house, and the expression Anthony
saw upon her face showed only the
slightest possible surprise&mdash;certainly no
other feeling.</p>
<p>Juliet rose. &#8220;Ah, Mr. Lockwood,&#8221; she
said, with a cordiality, sincere little person
though she was, Anthony knew for once
she did not feel. &#8220;In the dusk I couldn&#8217;t
be quite sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lockwood&#8217;s eyes instantly turned to
Rachel. That he had known in some way
whom he was to see was evident from a
most unusual agitation in his manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs.&mdash;Huntington,&#8221; he got out somehow,
taking her hand, and staring eagerly
down into her face, &#8220;I heard you were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
home, and I hoped to find you here. I&mdash;you
are&mdash;I am extremely glad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Half an hour later Anthony came upon
his wife in the darkness of the dining-room.
&#8220;Oh, you shouldn&#8217;t have left them
when I was away,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Little
Tony cried out and I had to go. I know
Rachel doesn&#8217;t want to be left with him
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angels and chaperons defend us,&#8221; muttered
Anthony. &#8220;I can&#8217;t stand it forever
to feel a man wanting to kill me for staying
by him through a meeting like this, after
three years. I didn&#8217;t know but Lockwood
would attempt to throw me off my own
porch. Give him a chance&mdash;he hasn&#8217;t any,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s after nine,&#8221; whispered Juliet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it. Roger&#8217;s taking a terrible
risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t know she&#8217;s here. But I
thought he cared enough for us to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been so sure of. He&#8217;s
probably been detained by some case. He&#8217;s
getting so distinguished, the minute he sets
foot in town now the folks with things the
matter with them begin to block his path.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
I hope she knows what she throws over her
shoulder if she refuses him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that she&#8217;s going to have a
chance to refuse him,&#8221; mourned Juliet.
&#8220;Do you think he&#8217;d ever forgive us if we let
him get away without knowing she was
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lockwood found it out, somehow.
Carey&#8217;s safe to tell him if he sees him&mdash;and
he&#8217;s pretty sure to, at Roger&#8217;s club.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t telephone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where? If he can he&#8217;ll come here, if
only to get news of her. She&#8217;s never let
him write to her, has she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me she hadn&#8217;t when he was
here last fall. And she didn&#8217;t know where
he was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellow-conspirator,&#8221; whispered Anthony,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll give fate her chance to-night.
If she bungles the game we&#8217;ll take
it into our own hands to-morrow. But
I&#8217;ve a feeling I&#8217;d like to let it happen by
itself, if it will.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Lockwood had gone&mdash;which was
not until eleven o&#8217;clock, in spite of the way
his hosts remained in his vicinity&mdash;Rachel
stood still upon the porch smiling a little
wearily at Juliet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My staying all night has been settled
for me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There was no way to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Luckily for us,&#8221; Juliet answered. &#8220;Sit
here a little longer, dear. It&#8217;s such a
perfect night, and I know we shall see little
enough of you when you get at work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rachel dropped into the hammock. &#8220;I
should like to lie here all night,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and watch the stars until I go to sleep.
I&#8217;ve done that so many, many nights from
under a tent flap.&#8221;</p>
<p>All at once she looked up, her eyes
widening. Upon the porch step stood a
strong figure&mdash;as unlike Lockwood&#8217;s gracefully
slender one as possible. A man&#8217;s
eyes were gazing steadily down into hers&mdash;determined
gray eyes, with a light in them.
The two faces were plainly visible to each
other in the radiance from the open door.</p>

<h2>XXVIII.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A High-Handed Affair</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If she had not been standing in the doorway
Juliet would have run away, but she
had to welcome Dr. Roger Barnes, a traveler
whom she had not seen for almost a year.
Her presence, however, after one glad greeting,
seemed not to bother him much. He
turned from her to Rachel, who had
risen, and took her outstretched hand in
both his.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been rather a long evening,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;wandering around and around this
place, waiting for the other man to go. I
explored the orchard and the willow path,
and every familiar haunt. I had to refresh
myself occasionally by stealing up for a
glimpse of your face between the vines.
But, somehow, that only made it harder to
wait. I had to march myself off again
with my fists gripped tight in my pockets
to keep them off that fellow, eating you up
with his eyes&mdash;confound him&mdash;you, who
belong only to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not smile as he said the last words,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
but stood looking eagerly at her with a gaze
that never faltered. She tried to draw her
hands away; it was useless. Juliet slipped
off, knowing that neither of them would
see her go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down on the lawn with me,&#8221;
he said, but she resisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please stay here, Doctor Barnes,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and please let me have my hand. I
can&#8217;t talk so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t talk&mdash;for a while,&#8221; he answered.
He sat down facing her. &#8220;At
six o&#8217;clock I found out you were here.
At eight&mdash;as soon as I could get away&mdash;I
came out. I told you how I spent
the evening. If I had needed anything to
sharpen my longing for you that would
have done it&mdash;but I think I had reached
about the limit of what I could bear in that
line already. It has been one constant
augmenting thirst for a draught that was
out of my reach. I shouldn&#8217;t have kept
my promise not to write you another day
after I had been here this time and heard&mdash;what
I have heard, Rachel.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer. Her face was turned
away; she was very still. Only a slightly
quickened breathing, of which he was barely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
conscious, betrayed to him that this was not
listening of an ordinary sort.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have said anything could
make any difference with my feeling, to
strengthen it,&#8221; he went on very quietly,
after a while, &#8220;but I find it has. I don&#8217;t
try to explain it to myself, except by the
one thing I am sure of&mdash;that Alexander
Huntington was the noblest and most
heroic of men, and deserved to the full
those last few hours of knowledge that you
had taken his name. And I can understand
your loyalty to him in wishing to
wear it these three years. But, Rachel, I
can&#8217;t let you wear it any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned her face a shade farther away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am leaving to-morrow night for
another year&#8217;s absence.&#8221; He spoke as
simply as if he were discussing the most
ordinary of subjects. &#8220;So I can see but one
thing to do, and that is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He got up and came around behind her,
standing in the shadow of the vines, where
the light did not touch him&mdash;&#8220;and that is,
to take you with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had not said it doubtfully, although
his inflection was very gentle. She moved
quickly, startled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Barnes&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m ready for them. You can&#8217;t
raise an objection that I&#8217;m not ready for,
not one that I can&#8217;t meet&mdash;except one.
And that you can&#8217;t raise, Rachel.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was silent, the words upon her lips
held in check by this last bold declaration.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see you can&#8217;t, being truthful,&#8221;
he said, smiling a little. &#8220;If I seem too
confident, forgive me; but I&#8217;ve carried
with me all these years that one look, when
you forgot to veil your eyes away from
me as you always had&mdash;and always have
since then. When I get that look from
you again&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He paused, drawing a
long breath. &#8220;I don&#8217;t dare dream of it.
Rachel, will you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>She tried to glance at him, and managed
it, but no higher than his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am engaged to take the training for
nurses at the Larchmont Memorial&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
she began.</p>
<p>But he interrupted her joyfully. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t say, &#8216;I don&#8217;t love you&#8216;&mdash;it&#8217;s
only, &#8216;I was intending to be a nurse.&#8217; I
told you you couldn&#8217;t say it, because it
isn&#8217;t true. You do love me, Rachel. Tell
me so.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>Her hurried breathing was plainly perceptible
now. She rose quickly, as if she
could not bear the telltale lamplight upon
her face any longer, and went hurriedly
across the porch and down upon the lawn,
into the starlight. He followed her, his
pulses bounding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, give up to me,&#8221; he said in her ear,
his own breath coming fast. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
been fighting it four years now&mdash;it&#8217;s no use.
We were made for each other, and we&#8217;ve
known it from the first. You stood heroically
by your first promise&mdash;you gave him
all you could; but that&#8217;s all over. You
don&#8217;t have to be true to anything or anybody
now but me. Give up, dear, and let
me know what it feels like to have you pull
a man toward you instead of pushing him
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached the edge of the orchard&mdash;in
deep shadow; and she stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I came down here
for,&#8221; she said, in confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do; you were running away. It&#8217;s
your instinct to run away&mdash;I love you for
it&mdash;it&#8217;s what first made me want to follow.
But I can&#8217;t stand your running away much
longer. Look, Rachel, can you see? I&#8217;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
holding out my arms. Rachel&mdash;I can&#8217;t
wait&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant longer she held out, while
he stood silent, holding himself that he
might have the long-dreamed-of joy of receiving
her surrender. Then, all at once,
he realised that it had been worth all his
days of patient and impatient waiting, for
turning to him at last she gave herself,
with the abandon such natures are capable
of showing when they yield after long
resistance, into the arms which closed
hungrily around her.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>If anybody could have told what happened
during the next twenty-four hours it
would have been Juliet, for it was she who
took the helm of affairs. She lay awake
half the night, or what there was left of it
after the doctor had come back with Rachel
and told his friends what had happened and
what was yet to happen, planning to make
the hasty wedding as ideal as might be.
She was a wonderful planner, and a most
energetic and enthusiastic young matron
as well, so by five in the afternoon she had
accomplished all that had seemed to her
good. Rachel&#8217;s part was only to see that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
her trunk was packed, her explanations
offered and good-byes said, and her choice
made of several exquisite white gowns which
Juliet had had sent out from town.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t be married in white, Mrs.
Robeson,&#8221; she had said protestingly when
Juliet had opened the boxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you can&mdash;and must. This is your
only bridal, dear. The other&mdash;you know
that was only what the doctor said of it
once&mdash;&#8216;your hand in his to the last&#8217;&mdash;the
hand of a friend. But this&mdash;isn&#8217;t this
different?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rachel had turned away her face.
&#8220;Yes, this is different,&#8221; she had owned.
&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He asked me to beg you for him to have
it so,&#8221; Juliet urged, and Rachel was silent.
So the simplest of the white frocks it was,
and in it Rachel looked as Juliet had meant
she should.</p>
<p>Only Judith and Wayne Carey were
asked down to see them married. To
humour the doctor the ceremony was
performed in the orchard, near the entrance
to the willow path. The time afterward
was short, and before she knew it Juliet was
bidding the two good-bye.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got her,&#8221; said the doctor, looking
from Juliet to Rachel, who stood at his side.
&#8220;She&#8217;s mine&mdash;all mine. I have to keep
saying it over and over to make sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For your comfort,&#8221; answered Juliet,
smiling at them both, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you that she
looks as if she were yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she?&#8221; he cried, laughing happily.
&#8220;How does she look?&#8221; He turned and surveyed
her. &#8220;She looks very proud and
sweet and still&mdash;she&#8217;s always been those
things&mdash;and very beautiful&mdash;more beautiful
than ever before. But do you think she
really looks as if she were mine? Tell me
how.&#8221;</p>
<p>Juliet turned from him, big and eager like
a boy, to his bride, &#8220;proud and sweet and
still,&#8221; as he had said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen
Rachel look absolutely happy before,&#8221; she
told him. &#8220;There&#8217;s always been a bit of a
shadow. But now&mdash;look down into her
eyes, Roger; there&#8217;s no shadow there
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when he would have looked Rachel&#8217;s
lashes fell. &#8220;Not yet? By-and-by then,
Rachel,&#8221; he whispered. Then he turned to
Juliet&mdash;and Anthony, who had come up to
stand beside her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for you and your
home-making this day would never have
come for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have been
good friends and true, to us both. Let us
keep you so&mdash;and good-bye.&#8221;</p>

</div>

<p>On a July evening, a month later, Cathcart
and a great roll of architects&#8217; paper
arrived on the Robeson porch. For an
hour Juliet looked and listened, while
Anthony, as he had promised, said not a
word to bias her decision. Cathcart laid
before her plans for a new house which
were&mdash;even Anthony could but admit to
himself beyond praise. From every standpoint&mdash;the
artistic, the domestic, the practical,
even the economical, so far as the
modern architect understands the meaning
of the word&mdash;the plans were ideal. Juliet
studied them absorbedly, showing plainly
her appreciation of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a beautiful home,&#8221; she said
at length. &#8220;I can think of nothing more
perfect than such a house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cathcart looked triumphant. Without
glancing at Anthony he produced another
set of plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just to please myself, Mrs. Robeson,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
he announced, &#8220;I have spent some interesting
hours in trying to show what could be
done with this old house, should any one
care to lay out a reasonable sum upon it.
Frankly, old houses never repay much expenditure
of money, yet there is a certain
satisfaction in working out the details of
restoration and improvement which makes
interesting study. Purely as a matter of that
sort I have fancied such extensions as these.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laid the plans before her. Juliet
looked, bent over them, cried out with delight,
and called upon Anthony to join her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Cathcart,&#8221; she said eagerly,
&#8220;before you proved yourself an exceedingly
fine architect; but now you show yourself
a master. To make this of the old house&mdash;why,
it&#8217;s far the higher art.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anthony glanced, laughing, across at
Cathcart, whose face had fallen so pronouncedly
that Juliet would have seen it
if she had been observing. But she was too
absorbed in the new plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could do this,&#8221; she was saying,
&#8220;it would satisfy my best ideals of a permanent
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear Mrs. Robeson,&#8221; stammered
the man of castles, &#8220;consider the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
location&mdash;the neighbourhood&mdash;the rural
character of the surroundings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; she answered, still studying the
plans. &#8220;I love them all&mdash;and the old home
most of all. Ever since I knew&#8221;&mdash;how
had she known? they wondered&mdash;&#8220;that a
change of houses was a possible thing for us
I have been homesick in anticipation of a
change I couldn&#8217;t bear to think of. Yet I
wondered if we ought to go. But if you can
make this of the old home&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted to her husband an enthusiastic
face. His eyes met hers in a long look in
which each read deep into the mind of the
other. Then Anthony Robeson, like a man
who hears precisely what he most wants to
hear, turned smiling to Cathcart.</p>

<p><b>WINDSOR CASTLE.</b> A Historical Romance of the Reign of Henry VIII,
Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth, Cloth.
12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Windsor Castle&#8221; is the story of Henry VIII., Catharine, and Anne
Boleyn. &#8220;Bluff King Hal,&#8221; although a well-loved monarch, was none too
good a one in many ways. Of all his selfishness and unwarrantable acts,
none was more discreditable than his divorce from Catharine, and his marriage
to the beautiful Anne Boleyn. The King&#8217;s love was as brief as it
was vehement. Jane Seymour, waiting maid on the Queen, attracted him,
and Anne Boleyn was forced to the block to make room for her successor.
This romance is one of extreme interest to all readers.</p>

<p><b>HORSESHOE ROBINSON.</b> A tale of the Tory Ascendency in South Carolina
in 1780. By John P. Kennedy. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by
Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Among the old favorites in the field of what is known as historical fiction,
there are none which appeal to a larger number of Americans than
Horseshoe Robinson, and this because it is the only story which depicts
with fidelity to the facts the heroic efforts of the colonists in South Carolina
to defend their homes against the brutal oppression of the British
under such leaders as Cornwallis and Tarleton.</p>
<p>The reader is charmed with the story of love which forms the thread
of the tale, and then impressed with the wealth of detail concerning those
times. The picture of the manifold sufferings of the people, is never overdrawn,
but painted faithfully and honestly by one who spared neither
time nor labor in his efforts to present in this charming love story all that
price in blood and tears which the Carolinians paid as their share in the
winning of the republic.</p>
<p>Take it all in all, &#8220;Horseshoe Robinson&#8221; is a work which should be
found on every book-shelf, not only because it is a most entertaining
story, but because of the wealth of valuable information concerning the
colonists which it contains. That it has been brought out once more, well
illustrated, is something which will give pleasure to thousands who have
long desired an opportunity to read the story again, and to the many who
have tried vainly in these latter days to procure a copy that they might
read it for the first time.</p>

<p><b>THE PEARL OF ORR&#8217;S ISLAND.</b> A story of the Coast of Maine. By
Harriet Beecher Stowe. Cloth, 12mo. Illustrated. Price, $1.00.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Written prior to 1862, the &#8220;Pearl of Orr&#8217;s Island&#8221; is ever new: a book
filled with delicate fancies, such as seemingly array themselves anew each
time one reads them. One sees the &#8220;sea like an unbroken mirror all
around the pine-girt, lonely shores of Orr&#8217;s Island&#8221; and straightway
comes &#8220;the heavy, hollow moan of the surf on the beach, like the wild
angry howl of some savage animal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Who can read of the beginning of that sweet life, named Mara, which
came into this world under the very shadow of the Death angel&#8217;s wings,
without having an intense desire to know how the premature bud blossomed?
Again and again one lingers over the descriptions of the character
of that baby boy Moses, who came through the tempest, amid the
angry billows, pillowed on his dead mother&#8217;s breast.</p>
<p>There is no more faithful portrayal of New England life than that
which Mrs. Stowe gives in &#8220;The Pearl of Orr&#8217;s Island.&#8221;</p>

Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank.
Price, $1.00.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>The &#8220;Gunpowder Plot&#8221; was a modest attempt to blow up Parliament,
the King and his Counsellors. James of Scotland, then King of England,
was weak-minded and extravagant. He hit upon the efficient scheme of
extorting money from the people by imposing taxes on the Catholics. In
their natural resentment to this extortion, a handful of bold spirits concluded
to overthrow the government. Finally the plotters were arrested,
and the King put to torture Guy Fawkes and the other prisoners with
royal vigor. A very intense love story runs through the entire romance.</p>
</div>
<p><b>THE SPIRIT OF THE BORDER.</b> A Romance of the Early Settlers in the
Ohio Valley. By Zane Grey. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>A book rather out of the ordinary is this &#8220;Spirit of the Border.&#8221; The
main thread of the story has to do with the work of the Moravian missionaries
in the Ohio Valley. Incidentally the reader is given details of the
frontier life of those hardy pioneers who broke the wilderness for the planting
of this great nation. Chief among these, as a matter of course, is
Lewis Wetzel, one of the most peculiar, and at the same time the most
admirable of all the brave men who spent their lives battling with the
savage foe, that others might dwell in comparative security.</p>
<p>Details of the establishment and destruction of the Moravian &#8220;Village
of Peace&#8221; are given at some length, and with minute description. The
efforts to Christianize the Indians are described as they never have been
before, and the author has depicted the characters of the leaders of the
several Indian tribes with great care, which of itself will be of interest to
the student.</p>
<p>By no means least among the charms of the story are the vivid word-pictures
of the thrilling adventures, and the intense paintings of the beauties
of nature, as seen in the almost unbroken forests.</p>
<p>It is the spirit of the frontier which is described, and one can by it,
perhaps, the better understand why men, and women, too, willingly braved
every privation and danger that the westward progress of the star of empire
might be the more certain and rapid. A love story, simple and tender,
runs through the book.</p>

<p>In 1829 Mr. James published his first romance, &#8220;Richelieu,&#8221; and was
recognized at once as one of the masters of the craft.</p>
<p>In this book he laid the story during those later days of the great cardinal&#8217;s
life, when his power was beginning to wane, but while it was
yet sufficiently strong to permit now and then of volcanic outbursts which
overwhelmed foes and carried friends to the topmost wave of prosperity.
One of the most striking portions of the story is that of Cinq Mar&#8217;s conspiracy;
the method of conducting criminal cases, and the political trickery
resorted to by royal favorites, affording a better insight into the statecraft
of that day than can be had even by an exhaustive study of history.
It is a powerful romance of love and diplomacy, and in point of thrilling
and absorbing interest has never been excelled.</p>
